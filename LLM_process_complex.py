    The man pivots on his heel, shifting his weight to turn his body sharply while extending his opposite arm outward, creating a dramatic stance.

    The action 'original_action: {original_action}' may require detailed control over specific body parts. 
    Please evaluate the action and think carefully about how the movement breaks down into smaller steps. 
    You should independently decide the steps involved in completing this action.

    After thinking, provide a structured list of the steps involved in performing this action.

    <original_action>
    {original_action}
    </original_action>


    <REQUIREMENT>
    - Focus on describing the dynamic movement.
    - Highlight the necessary coordination between body parts.
    -Emphasize the importance of actions: Clearly require that each step must include key movement details, avoiding redundancy. 
    -Streamline the steps: Remind that the generated steps should be merged as much as possible, ensuring each step contains actual dynamic movements rather than empty descriptions.

        <FORMAT>

        The number of steps should be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4, depending on the TEMPORAL complexity of the action.Do not use too many steps if the action is simple. 2~3 steps are usually enough.  

         eg. 'run in a circle with one hand swinging',even if the action is complex by Spatial Composition, it is simple by Temporal. Apparently there is only one step of action and don't need to provide multiple steps. In this case, you can just provide one step. 

        For each step, use the words 'The man...'or 'The man's ...(body part)' to describe the action.
        Ensure the explanation is like:
        step1: The ...
        step2: The ...
        ...
