**Standard Manual for Human Motion Description**

This manual aims to standardize the language used by models when describing human poses and motions, making it more precise and specific while avoiding vague and abstract expressions. By employing a unified set of terms, phrases, and descriptive standards, it ensures that the content generated by the model is clear and consistent, making it easier for readers to understand and apply.

### **1. Introduction**

In the fields of artificial intelligence and computer vision, accurately describing human motion is crucial for the training and application of models. This manual provides a comprehensive and detailed set of guidelines to assist models in generating precise human motion descriptions, avoiding ambiguity and vagueness.

### **2. Basic Principles**

- **Precision**: Descriptions should be as specific as possible, providing clear angles, directions, positions, and motion details.
- **Consistency**: Use a uniform set of terms and phrases to ensure the descriptions are coherent and comprehensible.
- **Objectivity**: Avoid subjective evaluations or emotional tones, focusing on the statement of objective facts.
- **Conciseness**: Expressions should be brief and to the point, highlighting key information while avoiding redundancy.

### **3. Description Standards**

#### **3.1 Angle and Direction Descriptions**

**Angle Categories:**

- **Vertical**: Angle ≤ 10°
  - **Example**: *“The arm is raised vertically.”*
- **Near Vertical**: 10° < Angle ≤ 30°
  - **Example**: *“The thigh is nearly vertical to the ground.”*
- **Diagonal**: 30° < Angle ≤ 60°
  - **Example**: *“The arm extends at a 45-degree angle to the front side.”*
- **Near Horizontal**: 60° < Angle ≤ 80°
  - **Example**: *“The lower leg is nearly horizontal.”*
- **Horizontal**: Angle > 80°
  - **Example**: *“The arms are extended horizontally to the sides.”*

**Direction Descriptions:**

- **Front, Back, Left, Right, Up, Down**
  - **Example**: *“The head turns to the left.”*, *“The leg steps forward.”*
- **Inner, Outer**
  - **Example**: *“The palm rotates inward.”*, *“The toes point outward.”*
- **Clockwise, Counterclockwise**
  - **Example**: *“The arm rotates in a clockwise direction.”*

#### **3.2 Motion Type Descriptions**

- **Static Motion**: Maintaining a pose without movement.
  - **Example**: *“He stands still with his hands by his sides.”*
- **Continuous Motion**: Motion ongoing without interruption.
  - **Example**: *“She continues to run with a steady pace.”*
- **Repetitive Motion**: Actions that are repeated in a regular pattern.
  - **Example**: *“He jumps up and down repeatedly.”*
- **Single Motion**: An action that is completed once.
  - **Example**: *“She raises her arm and waves.”*

#### **3.3 Motion Amplitude and Degree Descriptions**

- **Complete**: The action reaches its maximum range.
  - **Example**: *“The knee is bent completely to bring the calf against the thigh.”*
- **Large Amplitude**: The action is close to its maximum range.
  - **Example**: *“He swings his arm widely.”*
- **Medium Amplitude**: The action reaches a general range.
  - **Example**: *“She raises her leg at a moderate height.”*
- **Small Amplitude**: The action has a small range.
  - **Example**: *“He slightly shakes his head.”*
- **Slightly**: The action amplitude is minimal, with little change.
  - **Example**: *“She slightly lifts her chin.”*

#### **3.4 Time and Frequency Descriptions**

- **One-time**: The action occurs only once.
  - **Example**: *“He presses the button.”*
- **Continuous**: The action is performed uninterrupted over time.
  - **Example**: *“She is continuously stretching her body.”*
- **Intermittent**: The action occurs at intervals.
  - **Example**: *“He intermittently types on the keyboard.”*
- **Frequent**: The action repeats multiple times in a short period.
  - **Example**: *“She blinks frequently.”*
- **Slow**: The action is performed at a slow pace.
  - **Example**: *“He slowly raises his arm.”*
- **Fast**: The action is performed at a fast pace.
  - **Example**: *“She quickly turns around.”*

#### **3.5 Position and Spatial Relationship Descriptions**

- **Contact**: Between body parts or with an object.
  - **Example**: *“The palm is pressed against the wall.”*
- **Distance**: Describing the space between two body parts or objects.
  - **Close**: Distance ≤ 0.2 meters
    - **Example**: *“The feet are close together.”*
  - **Apart**: 0.2 meters < Distance ≤ 0.5 meters
    - **Example**: *“The hands are shoulder-width apart.”*
  - **Far Apart**: Distance > 0.5 meters
    - **Example**: *“The arms are extended far from the body.”*
- **Height**: Relative to the ground or other reference points.
  - **Below, Equal to, Above**
    - **Example**: *“The shoulder height is equal to the table height.”*
