    "\n",
    "This manual aims to standardize the language used by models when describing human poses and motions, making it more precise and specific while avoiding vague and abstract expressions. By employing a unified set of terms, phrases, and descriptive standards, it ensures that the content generated by the model is clear and consistent, making it easier for readers to understand and apply.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **1. Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the fields of artificial intelligence and computer vision, accurately describing human motion is crucial for the training and application of models. This manual provides a comprehensive and detailed set of guidelines to assist models in generating precise human motion descriptions, avoiding ambiguity and vagueness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Basic Principles**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Precision**: Descriptions should be as specific as possible, providing clear angles, directions, positions, and motion details.\n",
    "- **Consistency**: Use a uniform set of terms and phrases to ensure the descriptions are coherent and comprehensible.\n",
    "- **Objectivity**: Avoid subjective evaluations or emotional tones, focusing on the statement of objective facts.\n",
    "- **Conciseness**: Expressions should be brief and to the point, highlighting key information while avoiding redundancy.\n",

    "        - **Direction**: In which direction the movement occurs (e.g., upward, downward, forward, backward).\n",
    "        - **Intensity**: Is the movement fast or slow? Sudden or smooth?\n",
    "        - **Positioning**: The final position of the body part (e.g., shoulder height, bent at the knee).\n",
