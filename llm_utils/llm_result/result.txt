step1: The man's legs are positioned wide apart, providing a stable base as he begins the rowing motion, engaging his thighs and hips to initiate the movement.
step2: The man's arms pull back in a rowing motion while his back engages, coordinating with his legs to provide propulsion, resulting in a dynamic full-body exercise.
Action:
The person performs a rowing motion with their legs spread wide.
Sequence Explanation:
step1: The man's legs are positioned wide apart, providing a stable base as he begins the rowing motion, engaging his thighs and hips to initiate the movement.
step2: The man's arms pull back in a rowing motion while his back engages, coordinating with his legs to provide propulsion, resulting in a dynamic full-body exercise.

step1: The man sits with his legs spread wide, anchoring his feet firmly on the ground.
step2: The man's arms extend forward, grasping an imaginary oar, while he pulls the oar back towards his torso, simultaneously leaning back slightly to engage his core.
step3: The man's legs push against the ground as he drives forward, extending his legs while the arms return to the starting position, ready for the next stroke.
