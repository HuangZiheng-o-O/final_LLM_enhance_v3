Action: 
The person performs a rowing motion with their legs spread wide.
Sequence Explanation: 
step1: The man's legs are positioned wide apart, providing a stable base as he begins the rowing motion, engaging his thighs and hips to initiate the movement.  
step2: The man's arms pull back in a rowing motion while his back engages, coordinating with his legs to provide propulsion, resulting in a dynamic full-body exercise.
