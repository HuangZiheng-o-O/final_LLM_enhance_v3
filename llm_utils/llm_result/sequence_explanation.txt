Action: 
The person performs a rowing motion with their legs spread wide.
Sequence Explanation: 
step1: The man's legs are positioned wide apart, providing a stable base as he begins the rowing motion, engaging his thighs and hips to initiate the movement.  
step2: The man's arms pull back in a rowing motion while his back engages, coordinating with his legs to provide propulsion, resulting in a dynamic full-body exercise.

Action: 
The person performs a rowing motion with their legs spread wide.
Sequence Explanation: 
1. The man stabilizes his torso and initiates the rowing motion by bending at the knees, engaging his legs outward to create a wide stance.  
2. The man's arms pull back in a coordinated movement simulating rowing, while his legs remain spread wide, allowing for balance and proper body mechanics as he engages his core to maintain posture.

Action: 
The person performs a rowing motion with their legs spread wide.
Sequence Explanation: 
step1: The man sits on a stable surface with his legs spread wide apart and engages his core while leaning forward slightly.  
step2: The man's arms pull back in a rowing motion while simultaneously pushing his legs outward, resulting in a coordinated back and leg movement that mimics the action of rowing.
