    "\n",
    "This manual aims to standardize the language used by models when describing human poses and motions, making it more precise and specific while avoiding vague and abstract expressions. By employing a unified set of terms, phrases, and descriptive standards, it ensures that the content generated by the model is clear and consistent, making it easier for readers to understand and apply.\n",

    "### **1. Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the fields of artificial intelligence and computer vision, accurately describing human motion is crucial for the training and application of models. This manual provides a comprehensive and detailed set of guidelines to assist models in generating precise human motion descriptions, avoiding ambiguity and vagueness.\n",

    "### **2. Basic Principles**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Precision**: Descriptions should be as specific as possible, providing clear angles, directions, positions, and motion details.\n",
    "- **Consistency**: Use a uniform set of terms and phrases to ensure the descriptions are coherent and comprehensible.\n",
    "- **Objectivity**: Avoid subjective evaluations or emotional tones, focusing on the statement of objective facts.\n",
    "- **Conciseness**: Expressions should be brief and to the point, highlighting key information while avoiding redundancy.\n",
