## Method

### Main Prompt 

````

**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open. So, avoid using a closed trajectory for an open path like S, a common error is to make it like shape 8.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.
Emphasize once again: To ensure a smooth transition, you need to adjust the formulas for each segment so that they start from the endpoint coordinates of the previous segment, rather than independently redefining ( x ) and ( y ). If there are multiple segments, the starting and ending coordinates for each segment should be clearly marked in the comments as **start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y**.Emphasize once again: To ensure a smooth transition, you need to adjust the formulas for each segment so that they start from the endpoint coordinates of the previous segment, rather than independently redefining ( x ) and ( y ). If there are multiple segments, the starting and ending coordinates for each segment should be clearly marked in the comments as **start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y**.
Emphasize once again: To ensure a smooth transition, you need to adjust the formulas for each segment so that they start from the endpoint coordinates of the previous segment, rather than independently redefining \( x \) and \( y \). If there are multiple segments, the starting and ending coordinates for each segment should be clearly marked in the comments as **start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y**.

4. **Mathematical Functions:** Present the final code strictly in the form provided below, ensuring it is correct and can run without errors and READY TO USE.

**Code Format:**
```python
def shape_curve(t):xz
    ...

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (start_value, end_value)
```

Now the input is:

## Test Result:

### S-shaped: a man walks and waves his hands in the trajectory of a S-shape

```

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'S-shaped: a man walks and waves his hands in the trajectory of a S-shape'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."
```

**Model Output**

````
Model: To tackle the provided task, we need to focus on defining an "S-shape" trajectory. Since an "S-shape" is an open curve, we should design the trajectory to reflect that. The curve will smoothly transition from one segment to the next, maintaining consistent motion.

### Trajectory Decision

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:**
   The trajectory for an "S-shape" is **open**.

### Trajectory Analysis

For an "S-shaped" curve, imagine tracing an S from top to bottom. This entails moving in a smooth wave-like fashion.

### Mathematical Functions

To mathematically describe this, we can use parametric equations involving sine functions, which naturally create wave shapes. To form an "S", we need two connected wave segments facing opposite directions.

Here is the breakdown and the code implementing this:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # The "S" shape can be approximated by combining two half-period sine waves offset horizontally.
    # First half-wave
    if 0 <= t < 0.5:
        x = t
        y = np.sin(2 * np.pi * t + np.pi)  # Starts at top and goes downwards
    # Second half-wave
    elif 0.5 <= t <= 1:
        t_adjusted = t - 0.5
        x = 0.5 + t_adjusted
        y = -np.sin(2 * np.pi * t_adjusted + np.pi)  # Goes upwards

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t to be from 0 to 1.
t_range = (0, 1)
```

### Explanation

- **First Half-Wave:**
  - `0 <= t < 0.5`: It transitions the curve from top to bottom.
  - `x = t`: Moves in the positive x-direction linearly.
  - `y = np.sin(2 * np.pi * t + np.pi)`: Produces a downward sine wave for the first half.

- **Second Half-Wave:**
  - `0.5 <= t <= 1`: Comes after the first half.
  - `x = 0.5 + t_adjusted`: Continues the x-direction after the half point.
  - `y = -np.sin(2 * np.pi * t_adjusted + np.pi)`: Produces an upward sine wave for the second half.

This creates a smooth, continuous "S" trajectory that transitions naturally without abrupt changes, as requested.

def shape_curve(t):

        x = t
        y = np.sin(2 * np.pi * t + np.pi)  # Starts at top and goes downwards
    # Second half-wave
    elif 0.5 <= t <= 1:
        t_adjusted = t - 0.5
        x = 0.5 + t_adjusted
        y = -np.sin(2 * np.pi * t_adjusted + np.pi)  # Goes upwards

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t to be from 0 to 1.
t_range = (0, 1)

### Trapezoid: a man walks and waves his hands in the trajectory that forms a trapezoid with one pair of parallel sides.



```

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Trapezoid: a man walks in the trajectory that forms a trapezoid with one pair of parallel sides.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."

```

**Model Output**

````

Model: Given the description of a trapezoid with one pair of parallel sides, we'll define a closed trajectory that moves in the shape of a trapezoid. For simplicity, assume an isosceles trapezoid, where the non-parallel sides are of equal length.

### Closed Trajectory Decision:
The trapezoid shape is a closed trajectory because it returns to its starting point to form a complete figure.

### Trajectory Analysis:
To accurately describe this shape as a trajectory, we can break it down into four segments:
1. Starting from the bottom left corner, move right to form the bottom parallel side.
2. Move diagonally left and upward to form one of the non-parallel sides.
3. Move right again to form the top parallel side.
4. Finally, move diagonally downward to return to the starting point and complete the trapezoid.

Let's define this in mathematical terms, ensuring smooth transitions between each segment.

### Mathematical Functions:
```python
def shape_curve(t):
    # Define each segment of the trapezoid with smooth transitions
    if 0 <= t < 0.25:
        # Segment 1: Bottom side, moving right
        start_x, start_y = 0, 0
        end_x, end_y = 1, 0
        x = start_x + (end_x - start_x) * (t / 0.25)
        y = start_y
    
    elif 0.25 <= t < 0.5:
        # Segment 2: Left non-parallel side, moving diagonally
        start_x, start_y = 1, 0
        end_x, end_y = 0.7, 0.5
        x = start_x + (end_x - start_x) * ((t - 0.25) / 0.25)
        y = start_y + (end_y - start_y) * ((t - 0.25) / 0.25)
    
    elif 0.5 <= t < 0.75:
        # Segment 3: Top side, moving right
        start_x, start_y = 0.7, 0.5
        end_x, end_y = 0.3, 0.5
        x = start_x + (end_x - start_x) * ((t - 0.5) / 0.25)
        y = start_y
    
    else:
        # Segment 4: Right non-parallel side, moving downward to starting point
        start_x, start_y = 0.3, 0.5
        end_x, end_y = 0, 0
        x = start_x + (end_x - start_x) * ((t - 0.75) / 0.25)
        y = start_y + (end_y - start_y) * ((t - 0.75) / 0.25)

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 1)
```

Here, the trajectory is broken down into four segments, each corresponding to a side of the trapezoid. The above code ensures a continuous, closed path without jumps, while the speed is consistent across each segment. The trajectory returns to the starting point, completing the trapezoid.

### 'Spiral: a man walks and waves his hands in the trajectory that starts at the center and spirals outward.'

```

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Spiral: a man walks in the trajectory that starts at the center and spirals outward.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."

```

**Model Output**

````

Model: To accurately represent the trajectory described as a "Spiral: a man walks in the trajectory that starts at the center and spirals outward", the curve should be designed to increase in radius as it progresses, creating an outward spiraling effect. This can be effectively modeled using a parametric equation for a spiral.

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:**  
   The trajectory for a spiral as described is open, as it continuously moves outward and does not loop back on itself.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**  
   For a spiral, the movement can be envisioned as:
   - Starting at a center point `(0, 0)`.
   - Gradually move outward in a circular path, increasing the distance from the center as you rotate.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:**  
   To form a spiral, we can use polar coordinates `(r, θ)`, where `r` (radius) increases with `θ` (angle). When converted to Cartesian coordinates `(x, y)`, the equations can be expressed using trigonometric functions. The radius `r` can be a linear function of `θ` to ensure the spiral moves outward uniformly.

Given this, we can define the spiral using the equations:
- \( r(t) = a + b \cdot t \), where `a` is the initial radius (set to 0) and `b` controls the rate of spiral expansion.
- \( x(t) = r(t) \cdot \cos(t) \)
- \( y(t) = r(t) \cdot \sin(t) \)

Let's present the trajectory with these considerations:

```python
import math

def shape_curve(t):
    # Parameters to control the spiral form
    a = 0  # Initial radius
    b = 0.1  # Spiral growth rate

    # Calculating the polar coordinates
    r = a + b * t

    # Converting polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates
    x = r * math.cos(t)
    y = r * math.sin(t)

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 20 * math.pi)  # Covers multiple turns in the spiral
```

This code will produce a spiral that starts at the origin `(0, 0)` and spirals outward as `t` increases. The range for `t` is set to encompass multiple turns of the spiral, providing a full representation of the described trajectory.

### Heart: a man walks and waves his hands in the trajectory that forms the shape of a heart.

```
Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Heart: a man walks in the trajectory that forms the shape of a heart.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


```

**Model Output**

````

Model: To create a trajectory that forms the shape of a heart, we need a trajectory that outlines the iconic curves and point of a heart. The heart shape can be broken down into two symmetric circular arcs at the top and a pointed end at the bottom.

Given that the heart shape is symmetric and closed, we ensure the trajectory smoothly follows this pattern. Let's start by defining the trajectory:

### Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:
The heart shape is a closed trajectory.

### Trajectory Analysis:
A heart shape consists of two symmetrical arcs at the top and a point at the bottom. We can mathematically approximate this using parametric equations for a heart shape.

### Mathematical Functions:
Let's implement a function for drawing a heart shape trajectory:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Heart shape parametric equations
    x = 16 * np.sin(t) ** 3
    y = 13 * np.cos(t) - 5 * np.cos(2 * t) - 2 * np.cos(3 * t) - np.cos(4 * t)
    
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 2 * np.pi)
```

### Explanation:
- The parametric equations for `x` and `y` are chosen to represent the heart shape. These equations generate the characteristic curves and pointed bottom of a heart.
- `t` ranges from `0` to `2π`, allowing a full cycle of the heart shape to be created smoothly and continuously.

This code is ready to plot a heart-shaped trajectory when fed into a function that evaluates it over the specified `t_range`.

### Wave: a man walks and waves his hands in the trajectory that follows a wavy pattern.

```
Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Wave: a man walks in the trajectory that follows a wavy pattern.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."

```

**Model Output**

````

Model: For this task, we need to create an open trajectory that follows a wavy pattern. The wave is a simple curve, so the trajectory can be directly defined using a sinusoidal function. Here's how you can represent this waveform in a mathematical function:

### Trajectory Analysis:

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Since a wave does not form a closed loop and just moves forward in a sinusoidal pattern, it is an open trajectory.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:** 
   - The wavy pattern can be represented as a sine wave. Hence, the trajectory will move horizontally while oscillating vertically.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** 
   - The sine wave is the ideal representation of this pattern because it naturally alternates up and down.
   - To maintain the uniform movement and speed, we'll adjust the parameters so that each oscillation is smooth and continuous.

### Final Mathematical Function:

The sine wave can be expressed with:
- `x(t) = t` (representing horizontal uniform movement over time)
- `y(t) = A * sin(B * t)` where `A` is the amplitude (height of the wave peaks) and `B` is the frequency (how many wave cycles happen in a unit of `t`).

```python
import math

def shape_curve(t):
    A = 5  # Amplitude of the wave
    B = 1  # Frequency of the wave

    x = t
    y = A * math.sin(B * t)

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t according to how long you wish the wave to extend. 
# For example, you can set the range to cover one full wave cycle or more.
t_range = (0, 10 * math.pi)  # This will cover 5 full wave cycles
```

### Explanation:
- **Amplitude (A)** is set to 5 units, meaning the wave oscillates 5 units above and below the central line (y = 0).
- **Frequency (B)** is set to 1, determining how many complete waves appear within the defined `t_range`.
- **Range of t** is chosen to cover several cycles of the wave, starting from 0 and ending at `10 * π`, giving us 5 full cycles given our frequency setup. Adjust this range depending on how long you want your wave to be.

This continuous function ensures even mapping of the wave trajectory over time (t), with no abrupt jumps or discontinuities.

def shape_curve(t):
    A = 5  # Amplitude of the wave

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t according to how long you wish the wave to extend.

### Circle: a man walks and waves his hands in the trajectory that forms a complete circle.

```
Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Circle: a man walks in the trajectory that forms a complete circle.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


```

**Model Output**

````

Model: To draw a trajectory that forms a complete circle, let's analyze the requirements:

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory is closed since a circle is a geometric figure that loops back to its starting point.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:** The description is straightforward as it defines a complete circle, so detailed breakdown is not needed.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** To ensure uniform speed and smoothness, we'll use trigonometric functions to represent the trajectory of the circle. The circle will have a radius `r`, and `t` will represent the angle in radians from 0 to \(2\pi\), which corresponds to the complete circle.

Here’s the trajectory code:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Radius of the circle
    r = 1  # You can adjust the radius as needed

    # Parametric equations for the circle
    x = r * np.cos(t)
    y = r * np.sin(t)

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t to draw a complete circle
t_range = (0, 2 * np.pi)
```

### Explanation:
- The circle is defined using parametric equations with angle `t`:
  - \( x(t) = r \cdot \cos(t) \)
  - \( y(t) = r \cdot \sin(t) \)
- `t_range` is set from 0 to \(2\pi\) to complete the circle.
- You can adjust the radius `r` as required for your specific application.

### Triangle: a man walks and waves his hands in the trajectory that forms an equilateral triangle.

```
Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Triangle: a man walks in the trajectory that forms an equilateral triangle.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


```

**Model Output**

````

Model: To create a trajectory that forms an equilateral triangle, you need a closed path. This means the start and end points of the trajectory coincide.

### Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:
- **Closed Trajectory**: An equilateral triangle is a geometric figure with equal sides and angle, therefore the trajectory is closed.

### Mathematical Functions:
We will break down the trajectory into three equal segments, each representing one side of the triangle. Assume the triangle is centered at the origin for simplicity.

The general approach is to form the trajectory as a function of `t` which rotates around 60 degrees per segment (since there are three equal angles of 60 degrees in an equilateral triangle).

### Mathematical Representation:
1. Define the center of the triangle at the origin.
2. The side length of the triangle will determine the amplitude of the movement.
3. Define three segments for each side of the triangle.

### Analysis:
- Ensure the trajectory transitions smoothly between segments.
- Use parametric equations to represent linear segments.

Here is the code that represents the trajectory in the form of an equilateral triangle centered at the origin:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Side length of the equilateral triangle
    side_length = 1
    # Height of the equilateral triangle
    height = (np.sqrt(3) / 2) * side_length

    # Determine which segment the current `t` is in (assuming t is normalized between 0 and 3)
    segment_duration = 1  # Each segment takes 1 time unit

    if 0 <= t < segment_duration:
        # Movement along the first side
        t_segment = t / segment_duration
        start_x, start_y = -side_length / 2, -height / 3
        end_x, end_y = side_length / 2, -height / 3
        x = (1 - t_segment) * start_x + t_segment * end_x
        y = (1 - t_segment) * start_y + t_segment * end_y
    elif segment_duration <= t < 2 * segment_duration:
        # Movement along the second side
        t_segment = (t - segment_duration) / segment_duration
        start_x, start_y = side_length / 2, -height / 3
        end_x, end_y = 0, 2 * height / 3
        x = (1 - t_segment) * start_x + t_segment * end_x
        y = (1 - t_segment) * start_y + t_segment * end_y
    elif 2 * segment_duration <= t <= 3 * segment_duration:
        # Movement along the third side
        t_segment = (t - 2 * segment_duration) / segment_duration
        start_x, start_y = 0, 2 * height / 3
        end_x, end_y = -side_length / 2, -height / 3
        x = (1 - t_segment) * start_x + t_segment * end_x
        y = (1 - t_segment) * start_y + t_segment * end_y
    
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 3)
```

### Explanation:
- The triangle is centered at the origin.
- Each segment of `t` corresponds to one side of the triangle.
- The parameter `t` ranges from 0 to 3, with each unit of `t` representing movement along one side of the triangle.
- Transitions between segments are smooth by using linear interpolation to ensure continuous motion.

### Pentagon: a man walks and waves his hands in the trajectory that forms a regular pentagon.

```
Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Pentagon: a man walks in the trajectory that forms a regular pentagon.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."

```

**Model Output**

````

Model: To draw a trajectory that forms a regular pentagon, we need to create a closed trajectory that outlines the shape of a pentagon.

### Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:
The trajectory for a regular pentagon is **closed** because it is a geometric figure that forms a closed path by connecting the start and end points.

### Extract the Trajectory:
For a regular pentagon, we can break down the trajectory into five equal linear segments with equal internal angles between them. Each side will involve moving in a straight line and then turning to form the next angle.

### Trajectory Analysis:
To ensure the trajectory is smooth and consistent, we need to calculate the movement along the pentagon's edges and ensure it's uniform across each segment. The internal angle of a regular pentagon is \(108\) degrees. We calculate the trajectory points based on these turns.

### Mathematical Functions:
For simplicity and to ensure uniform transition, we can calculate the movement using parametric equations for the pentagon's shape. Let's assume a circumscribed radius \(r\) of 1 for simplicity. We will distribute the `t` parameter such that it completes the pentagon while ensuring uniform speed and continuity between segments.

Here's the code that describes the pentagon shape a man walks in the trajectory function:

```python
import math

def shape_curve(t):
    # ensure that radians are used for angular divisions
    angle = math.radians(360 / 5)  # divide full circle (360 degrees) by 5 for pentagon
    r = 1  # assume a unit circumradius for simplicity

    # Calculate x, y based on parametric equations
    segment = int(t * 5)  # We divide the range of t into 5 segments (0 to 4)
    segment_t = t * 5 - segment  # Normalize t for each segment between 0 and 1

    # Calculate positions for the 5 vertices of the pentagon
    start_x = r * math.cos(segment * angle)
    start_y = r * math.sin(segment * angle)
    end_x = r * math.cos((segment + 1) * angle)
    end_y = r * math.sin((segment + 1) * angle)

    # Interpolate between start and end point based on segment_t
    x = (1 - segment_t) * start_x + segment_t * end_x
    y = (1 - segment_t) * start_y + segment_t * end_y

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (evenly divided for 5 segments)
t_range = (0, 1)
```

- **Explanation:**
  - We divide the trajectory into 5 equal segments, each corresponding to an edge of the pentagon.
  - The `t` parameter ranges from 0 to 1, and each segment internally subdivides it further into 5 equally, applying it to one side at a time.
  - Each vertex position is calculated based on the angle subtended at the center, and transitions between vertices are linear to maintain uniform speed.
  - The `shape_curve(t)` function ensures the trajectory forms a smooth and closed pentagon path.

### Infinity: a man walks and waves his hands in the trajectory that forms the shape of an infinity symbol.

```
Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Infinity: a man walks in the trajectory that forms the shape of an infinity symbol.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


```

**Model Output**

````

Model: To draw a trajectory forming the shape of an infinity symbol, we're dealing with a closed trajectory, as it loops back on itself continuously.

The mathematical equation for an infinity symbol (often referred to as a "lemniscate") can be represented using parametric equations. A common mathematical representation is:

\[ x(t) = A \cdot \cos(t) \]
\[ y(t) = B \cdot \sin(2t) \]

Where \( A \) and \( B \) are constants that can be adjusted to change the dimensions of the lemniscate. For a balanced infinity symbol, we'll often set \( A \) and \( B \) to the same value.

Here's how to implement it in a Python function:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Constants defining the size of the lemniscate
    A = 1  # Width scale factor
    B = 1  # Height scale factor
    
    # Parametric equations for the lemniscate (infinity symbol)
    x = A * np.cos(t)
    y = B * np.sin(2 * t)
    
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t to complete the shape
t_range = (0, 2 * np.pi)
```

This code will produce a continuous, smooth trajectory resembling an infinity symbol over the range \( t = 0 \) to \( t = 2\pi \). Adjust the constants \( A \) and \( B \) if you want to change the aspect ratio of the infinity symbol.

### Semicircle: a man walks and waves his hands in the trajectory that forms a half-circle.

```
Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Semicircle: a man walks in the trajectory that forms a half-circle.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."

```

**Model Output**

````

Model: To address the description given, we need to create a trajectory that forms a semicircle. This trajectory will be an open curve since a semicircle is not a closed figure. Here's how we can express this mathematically and in code:

**Trajectory Analysis:**

1. **Open Trajectory Decision:** Since the description asks for a semicircle, the trajectory is open.

2. **Trajectory Specification:** A semicircle can be represented by a segment of a circle. For simplicity, let’s consider a semicircle in the x-y plane, centered at the origin, and extending horizontally from -R to R. We'll choose the upper half of the circle.

3. We can use parametric equations to represent the semicircle trajectory:
   - \( x(t) = R \cdot \cos(t) \)
   - \( y(t) = R \cdot \sin(t) \)
   - Where \( t \) ranges from 0 to \( \pi \) to cover the semicircle.

4. We assume a uniform speed in tracing this semicircle, which means the parameter \( t \) will change linearly between the start and end values.

Here's the specific code to create a semicircle trajectory:

```python
import math

def shape_curve(t):
    R = 1  # Radius of the semicircle, adjust as needed
    x = R * math.cos(t)
    y = R * math.sin(t)
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t to cover the semicircle (from 0 to π radians)
t_range = (0, math.pi)
```

This code snippet will generate the (x, y) coordinates for a semicircle with a radius of 1. The parameter \( t \) will range from 0 to \( \pi \), which covers the upper half of the circle, thus forming a semicircle.

# Specify the range of t to cover the semicircle (from 0 to π radians)
