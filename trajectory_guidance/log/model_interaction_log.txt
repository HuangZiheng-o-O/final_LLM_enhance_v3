**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open. So, avoid using a closed trajectory for an open path like S, a common error is to make it like shape 8.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.
Emphasize once again: To ensure a smooth transition, you need to adjust the formulas for each segment so that they start from the endpoint coordinates of the previous segment, rather than independently redefining ( x ) and ( y ). If there are multiple segments, the starting and ending coordinates for each segment should be clearly marked in the comments as **start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y**.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'S-shaped:a man walk in the trjectory of a S-shape'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To tackle the provided task, we need to focus on defining an "S-shape" trajectory. Since an "S-shape" is an open curve, we should design the trajectory to reflect that. The curve will smoothly transition from one segment to the next, maintaining consistent motion.

### Trajectory Decision

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:**
   The trajectory for an "S-shape" is **open**.

### Trajectory Analysis

For an "S-shaped" curve, imagine tracing an S from top to bottom. This entails moving in a smooth wave-like fashion.

### Mathematical Functions

To mathematically describe this, we can use parametric equations involving sine functions, which naturally create wave shapes. To form an "S", we need two connected wave segments facing opposite directions.

Here is the breakdown and the code implementing this:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # The "S" shape can be approximated by combining two half-period sine waves offset horizontally.
    # First half-wave
    if 0 <= t < 0.5:
        x = t
        y = np.sin(2 * np.pi * t + np.pi)  # Starts at top and goes downwards
    # Second half-wave
    elif 0.5 <= t <= 1:
        t_adjusted = t - 0.5
        x = 0.5 + t_adjusted
        y = -np.sin(2 * np.pi * t_adjusted + np.pi)  # Goes upwards

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t to be from 0 to 1.
t_range = (0, 1)
```

### Explanation

- **First Half-Wave:**
  - `0 <= t < 0.5`: It transitions the curve from top to bottom.
  - `x = t`: Moves in the positive x-direction linearly.
  - `y = np.sin(2 * np.pi * t + np.pi)`: Produces a downward sine wave for the first half.

- **Second Half-Wave:**
  - `0.5 <= t <= 1`: Comes after the first half.
  - `x = 0.5 + t_adjusted`: Continues the x-direction after the half point.
  - `y = -np.sin(2 * np.pi * t_adjusted + np.pi)`: Produces an upward sine wave for the second half.

This creates a smooth, continuous "S" trajectory that transitions naturally without abrupt changes, as requested.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Walk forward, and turn (towards 10 o'clock) and continue walking , then turn (towards 10 o'clock) and continue walking .'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To create a trajectory for the given description, we need to break down the path into segments and analyze the movement at each step. The description suggests an open trajectory with a series of straight lines and consecutive turns towards the 10 o'clock direction.

Let's break it down:

### Trajectory Breakdown:
1. **First Segment:**
   - Walk forward. This implies a straight line heading directly ahead.
   - We assume a moderate distance for simplicity (e.g., 5 units).

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Turn towards the 10 o'clock direction (which is slightly to the left), and continue walking.
   - Continue for a similar distance.

3. **Third Segment:**
   - Again, turn slightly towards the 10 o'clock direction, and continue walking straight.

### Trajectory Analysis:
This describes an open trajectory that consists of straight lines with gentle left curves between them.

### Continuous and Smooth Trajectory:
- Ensure each segment starts where the last left off.
- Maintain uniform speed across the trajectory ensuring no instant jumps.

### Mathematical Path Specification:
We'll employ simple piecewise linear functions to represent each segment.

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    if 0 <= t < 1:
        # First segment: Walk forward
        x = 5 * t
        y = 0
    elif 1 <= t < 2:
        # Transition: Turn towards 10 o'clock (slightly left)
        # Second segment: Continue walking in new direction
        start_x, start_y = shape_curve(1) # Integration point
        x = start_x + (4 * (t - 1))
        y = start_y + (1 * (t - 1))
    elif 2 <= t <= 3:
        # Transition: Again turn towards 10 o'clock
        # Third segment: Continue walking in new direction
        start_x, start_y = shape_curve(2) # Integration point
        x = start_x + (3 * (t - 2))
        y = start_y + (2 * (t - 2))
    else:
        raise ValueError("t is out of the expected range")

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 3)
```

### Explanation:
- **Segment 1**: Moves straight along the x-axis from `(0, 0)` to `(5, 0)`.
- **Segment 2**: Starts at `(5, 0)`, turns slightly left, and moves roughly in a direction of `(4, 1)` units until `(9, 1)`.
- **Segment 3**: Starts at `(9, 1)`, turns again slightly left, and moves roughly `(3, 2)` units until `(12, 3)`.

This code reflects the described trajectory, maintaining uniform speed and smooth transitions between the segments.

Model: Based on the description provided, you want to represent a path that involves walking forward, turning right, and continuing to walk twice. This description suggests a relatively simple open trajectory that roughly forms a "U" shape, starting off in one direction, making two right-angle turns to continue walking in the final direction.

**Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:**
- This trajectory is open because the description does not imply returning to the starting point. It involves segments of walking with two right-angle turns.

**Trajectory Analysis:**
1. Walk forward.
2. Turn right and continue walking.
3. Turn right again and continue walking.

Let's define each segment:
1. Walk straight ahead for some distance.
2. Make a right turn (90 degrees) and continue walking forward for an equal distance.
3. Make another right turn (90 degrees) and walk forward for an equal distance.

**Mathematical Function:**

"I want to draw a Description = 'Trapezoid: using a trajectory that forms a trapezoid with one pair of parallel sides.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: Given the description of a trapezoid with one pair of parallel sides, we'll define a closed trajectory that moves in the shape of a trapezoid. For simplicity, assume an isosceles trapezoid, where the non-parallel sides are of equal length.

### Closed Trajectory Decision:
The trapezoid shape is a closed trajectory because it returns to its starting point to form a complete figure.

### Trajectory Analysis:
To accurately describe this shape as a trajectory, we can break it down into four segments:
1. Starting from the bottom left corner, move right to form the bottom parallel side.
2. Move diagonally left and upward to form one of the non-parallel sides.
3. Move right again to form the top parallel side.
4. Finally, move diagonally downward to return to the starting point and complete the trapezoid.

Let's define this in mathematical terms, ensuring smooth transitions between each segment.

**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open. So, avoid using a closed trajectory for an open path like S, a common error is to make it like shape 8.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.
Emphasize once again: To ensure a smooth transition, you need to adjust the formulas for each segment so that they start from the endpoint coordinates of the previous segment, rather than independently redefining ( x ) and ( y ). If there are multiple segments, the starting and ending coordinates for each segment should be clearly marked in the comments as **start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y**.

"I want to draw a Description = 'Spiral: using a trajectory that starts at the center and spirals outward.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To accurately represent the trajectory described as a "Spiral: using a trajectory that starts at the center and spirals outward", the curve should be designed to increase in radius as it progresses, creating an outward spiraling effect. This can be effectively modeled using a parametric equation for a spiral.

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:**  
   The trajectory for a spiral as described is open, as it continuously moves outward and does not loop back on itself.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**  
   For a spiral, the movement can be envisioned as:
   - Starting at a center point `(0, 0)`.
   - Gradually move outward in a circular path, increasing the distance from the center as you rotate.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:**  
   To form a spiral, we can use polar coordinates `(r, θ)`, where `r` (radius) increases with `θ` (angle). When converted to Cartesian coordinates `(x, y)`, the equations can be expressed using trigonometric functions. The radius `r` can be a linear function of `θ` to ensure the spiral moves outward uniformly.

Given this, we can define the spiral using the equations:
- \( r(t) = a + b \cdot t \), where `a` is the initial radius (set to 0) and `b` controls the rate of spiral expansion.
- \( x(t) = r(t) \cdot \cos(t) \)
- \( y(t) = r(t) \cdot \sin(t) \)

Let's present the trajectory with these considerations:

```python
import math

def shape_curve(t):
    # Parameters to control the spiral form
    a = 0  # Initial radius
    b = 0.1  # Spiral growth rate

    # Calculating the polar coordinates
    r = a + b * t

    # Converting polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates
    x = r * math.cos(t)
    y = r * math.sin(t)

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 20 * math.pi)  # Covers multiple turns in the spiral
```

This code will produce a spiral that starts at the origin `(0, 0)` and spirals outward as `t` increases. The range for `t` is set to encompass multiple turns of the spiral, providing a full representation of the described trajectory.

def shape_curve(t):

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Heart: using a trajectory that forms the shape of a heart.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To create a trajectory that forms the shape of a heart, we need a trajectory that outlines the iconic curves and point of a heart. The heart shape can be broken down into two symmetric circular arcs at the top and a pointed end at the bottom.

Given that the heart shape is symmetric and closed, we ensure the trajectory smoothly follows this pattern. Let's start by defining the trajectory:

### Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:
The heart shape is a closed trajectory.

### Trajectory Analysis:
A heart shape consists of two symmetrical arcs at the top and a point at the bottom. We can mathematically approximate this using parametric equations for a heart shape.

### Mathematical Functions:
Let's implement a function for drawing a heart shape trajectory:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Heart shape parametric equations
    x = 16 * np.sin(t) ** 3
    y = 13 * np.cos(t) - 5 * np.cos(2 * t) - 2 * np.cos(3 * t) - np.cos(4 * t)
    
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 2 * np.pi)
```

### Explanation:
- The parametric equations for `x` and `y` are chosen to represent the heart shape. These equations generate the characteristic curves and pointed bottom of a heart.
- `t` ranges from `0` to `2π`, allowing a full cycle of the heart shape to be created smoothly and continuously.

This code is ready to plot a heart-shaped trajectory when fed into a function that evaluates it over the specified `t_range`.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Wave: using a trajectory that follows a wavy pattern.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: For this task, we need to create an open trajectory that follows a wavy pattern. The wave is a simple curve, so the trajectory can be directly defined using a sinusoidal function. Here's how you can represent this waveform in a mathematical function:

### Trajectory Analysis:

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Since a wave does not form a closed loop and just moves forward in a sinusoidal pattern, it is an open trajectory.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:** 
   - The wavy pattern can be represented as a sine wave. Hence, the trajectory will move horizontally while oscillating vertically.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** 
   - The sine wave is the ideal representation of this pattern because it naturally alternates up and down.
   - To maintain the uniform movement and speed, we'll adjust the parameters so that each oscillation is smooth and continuous.

### Final Mathematical Function:

The sine wave can be expressed with:
- `x(t) = t` (representing horizontal uniform movement over time)
- `y(t) = A * sin(B * t)` where `A` is the amplitude (height of the wave peaks) and `B` is the frequency (how many wave cycles happen in a unit of `t`).

```python
import math

def shape_curve(t):
    A = 5  # Amplitude of the wave
    B = 1  # Frequency of the wave

    x = t
    y = A * math.sin(B * t)

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t according to how long you wish the wave to extend. 
# For example, you can set the range to cover one full wave cycle or more.
t_range = (0, 10 * math.pi)  # This will cover 5 full wave cycles
```

### Explanation:
- **Amplitude (A)** is set to 5 units, meaning the wave oscillates 5 units above and below the central line (y = 0).
- **Frequency (B)** is set to 1, determining how many complete waves appear within the defined `t_range`.
- **Range of t** is chosen to cover several cycles of the wave, starting from 0 and ending at `10 * π`, giving us 5 full cycles given our frequency setup. Adjust this range depending on how long you want your wave to be.

This continuous function ensures even mapping of the wave trajectory over time (t), with no abrupt jumps or discontinuities.
extracted_code: import math

def shape_curve(t):
    A = 5  # Amplitude of the wave
    B = 1  # Frequency of the wave

"I want to draw a Description = 'Circle: using a trajectory that forms a complete circle.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To draw a trajectory that forms a complete circle, let's analyze the requirements:

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory is closed since a circle is a geometric figure that loops back to its starting point.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:** The description is straightforward as it defines a complete circle, so detailed breakdown is not needed.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** To ensure uniform speed and smoothness, we'll use trigonometric functions to represent the trajectory of the circle. The circle will have a radius `r`, and `t` will represent the angle in radians from 0 to \(2\pi\), which corresponds to the complete circle.

Here’s the trajectory code:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Radius of the circle
    r = 1  # You can adjust the radius as needed

    # Parametric equations for the circle

    y = r * np.sin(t)

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t to draw a complete circle
t_range = (0, 2 * np.pi)
```

### Explanation:
- The circle is defined using parametric equations with angle `t`:
  - \( x(t) = r \cdot \cos(t) \)
  - \( y(t) = r \cdot \sin(t) \)
- `t_range` is set from 0 to \(2\pi\) to complete the circle.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Triangle: using a trajectory that forms an equilateral triangle.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To create a trajectory that forms an equilateral triangle, you need a closed path. This means the start and end points of the trajectory coincide.

### Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:
- **Closed Trajectory**: An equilateral triangle is a geometric figure with equal sides and angle, therefore the trajectory is closed.

### Mathematical Functions:
We will break down the trajectory into three equal segments, each representing one side of the triangle. Assume the triangle is centered at the origin for simplicity.

The general approach is to form the trajectory as a function of `t` which rotates around 60 degrees per segment (since there are three equal angles of 60 degrees in an equilateral triangle).

### Mathematical Representation:
1. Define the center of the triangle at the origin.
2. The side length of the triangle will determine the amplitude of the movement.
3. Define three segments for each side of the triangle.

### Analysis:
- Ensure the trajectory transitions smoothly between segments.
- Use parametric equations to represent linear segments.

Here is the code that represents the trajectory in the form of an equilateral triangle centered at the origin:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Side length of the equilateral triangle
    side_length = 1
    # Height of the equilateral triangle
    height = (np.sqrt(3) / 2) * side_length

    # Determine which segment the current `t` is in (assuming t is normalized between 0 and 3)
    segment_duration = 1  # Each segment takes 1 time unit

    if 0 <= t < segment_duration:
        # Movement along the first side
        t_segment = t / segment_duration
        start_x, start_y = -side_length / 2, -height / 3
        end_x, end_y = side_length / 2, -height / 3
        x = (1 - t_segment) * start_x + t_segment * end_x
        y = (1 - t_segment) * start_y + t_segment * end_y
    elif segment_duration <= t < 2 * segment_duration:
        # Movement along the second side
        t_segment = (t - segment_duration) / segment_duration
        start_x, start_y = side_length / 2, -height / 3
        end_x, end_y = 0, 2 * height / 3
        x = (1 - t_segment) * start_x + t_segment * end_x
        y = (1 - t_segment) * start_y + t_segment * end_y
    elif 2 * segment_duration <= t <= 3 * segment_duration:
        # Movement along the third side
        t_segment = (t - 2 * segment_duration) / segment_duration
        start_x, start_y = 0, 2 * height / 3
        end_x, end_y = -side_length / 2, -height / 3
        x = (1 - t_segment) * start_x + t_segment * end_x
        y = (1 - t_segment) * start_y + t_segment * end_y
    
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 3)
```

### Explanation:
- The triangle is centered at the origin.
- Each segment of `t` corresponds to one side of the triangle.
- The parameter `t` ranges from 0 to 3, with each unit of `t` representing movement along one side of the triangle.
- Transitions between segments are smooth by using linear interpolation to ensure continuous motion.

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open. So, avoid using a closed trajectory for an open path like S, a common error is to make it like shape 8.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.
Emphasize once again: To ensure a smooth transition, you need to adjust the formulas for each segment so that they start from the endpoint coordinates of the previous segment, rather than independently redefining ( x ) and ( y ). If there are multiple segments, the starting and ending coordinates for each segment should be clearly marked in the comments as **start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y**.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Pentagon: using a trajectory that forms a regular pentagon.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To draw a trajectory that forms a regular pentagon, we need to create a closed trajectory that outlines the shape of a pentagon.

### Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:
The trajectory for a regular pentagon is **closed** because it is a geometric figure that forms a closed path by connecting the start and end points.

### Extract the Trajectory:
For a regular pentagon, we can break down the trajectory into five equal linear segments with equal internal angles between them. Each side will involve moving in a straight line and then turning to form the next angle.

### Trajectory Analysis:
To ensure the trajectory is smooth and consistent, we need to calculate the movement along the pentagon's edges and ensure it's uniform across each segment. The internal angle of a regular pentagon is \(108\) degrees. We calculate the trajectory points based on these turns.

### Mathematical Functions:
For simplicity and to ensure uniform transition, we can calculate the movement using parametric equations for the pentagon's shape. Let's assume a circumscribed radius \(r\) of 1 for simplicity. We will distribute the `t` parameter such that it completes the pentagon while ensuring uniform speed and continuity between segments.

Here's the code that describes the pentagon shape using a trajectory function:

```python
import math

def shape_curve(t):
    # ensure that radians are used for angular divisions
    angle = math.radians(360 / 5)  # divide full circle (360 degrees) by 5 for pentagon
    r = 1  # assume a unit circumradius for simplicity

    # Calculate x, y based on parametric equations
    segment = int(t * 5)  # We divide the range of t into 5 segments (0 to 4)
    segment_t = t * 5 - segment  # Normalize t for each segment between 0 and 1

    # Calculate positions for the 5 vertices of the pentagon
    start_x = r * math.cos(segment * angle)
    start_y = r * math.sin(segment * angle)
    end_x = r * math.cos((segment + 1) * angle)
    end_y = r * math.sin((segment + 1) * angle)

    # Interpolate between start and end point based on segment_t
    x = (1 - segment_t) * start_x + segment_t * end_x
    y = (1 - segment_t) * start_y + segment_t * end_y

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (evenly divided for 5 segments)
t_range = (0, 1)
```

- **Explanation:**
  - We divide the trajectory into 5 equal segments, each corresponding to an edge of the pentagon.
  - The `t` parameter ranges from 0 to 1, and each segment internally subdivides it further into 5 equally, applying it to one side at a time.
  - Each vertex position is calculated based on the angle subtended at the center, and transitions between vertices are linear to maintain uniform speed.
  - The `shape_curve(t)` function ensures the trajectory forms a smooth and closed pentagon path.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Infinity: using a trajectory that forms the shape of an infinity symbol.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To draw a trajectory forming the shape of an infinity symbol, we're dealing with a closed trajectory, as it loops back on itself continuously.

The mathematical equation for an infinity symbol (often referred to as a "lemniscate") can be represented using parametric equations. A common mathematical representation is:

\[ x(t) = A \cdot \cos(t) \]
\[ y(t) = B \cdot \sin(2t) \]

Where \( A \) and \( B \) are constants that can be adjusted to change the dimensions of the lemniscate. For a balanced infinity symbol, we'll often set \( A \) and \( B \) to the same value.

Here's how to implement it in a Python function:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Constants defining the size of the lemniscate
    A = 1  # Width scale factor
    B = 1  # Height scale factor
    
    # Parametric equations for the lemniscate (infinity symbol)
    x = A * np.cos(t)
    y = B * np.sin(2 * t)
    
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t to complete the shape
t_range = (0, 2 * np.pi)
```

This code will produce a continuous, smooth trajectory resembling an infinity symbol over the range \( t = 0 \) to \( t = 2\pi \). Adjust the constants \( A \) and \( B \) if you want to change the aspect ratio of the infinity symbol.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Crescent: using a trajectory that forms the shape of a crescent moon.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To create a crescent shape, we'll need to draw two arcs: an outer arc and an inner arc, with the inner arc overlapping and partially obscuring the outer arc to form the crescent moon shape.

Here's how this can be broken down and implemented:

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory is closed because a crescent is a closed shape formed by two overlapping arcs.

2. **Trajectory Analysis:** We'll create two arcs:
   - The outer arc is a large semicircle.
   - The inner arc is a smaller semicircle that will overlap the outer arc to form the crescent shape.

3. **Mathematical Functions:** We'll use parametric equations for circles and semicircles to create these arcs. The idea is to subtract one semicircle (the smaller inner arc) from another (the larger outer arc) to form the crescent.

Here's the code to generate a crescent moon shape:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    if t < 0.5:
        # Outer arc (semi-circle)
        theta_outer = np.pi * t * 2  # Scaled to full circle
        x_outer = np.cos(theta_outer)
        y_outer = np.sin(theta_outer)
        return 2 * x_outer, 2 * y_outer
    else:
        # Inner arc (smaller semi-circle) shifted to overlap
        theta_inner = np.pi * (t - 0.5) * 2  # Scaled to full circle
        x_inner = np.cos(theta_inner)
        y_inner = np.sin(theta_inner)
        return 2 * (x_inner - 0.5), 2 * y_inner

# Specify the range of t.
t_range = (0, 1)
```

**Explanation:**
- We have divided `t` into two segments:
  - **Outer Arc (0 ≤ t < 0.5):** Forms the larger semicircle part of the crescent.
  - **Inner Arc (0.5 ≤ t ≤ 1):** Forms the smaller semicircle which overlaps the larger one, creating the crescent effect.
- Each arc starts at the previous one's end point to ensure continuity and smooth transitions.
- The `2` multiplier in coordinates ensures both arcs are about the same scale for good overlap, and the `0.5` shift ensures placement to mimic a typical crescent shape.

This code generates the trajectory for a crescent moon in a simple, smooth manner.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Lightning: using a trajectory that forms the shape of a lightning bolt.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To create a trajectory that forms the shape of a lightning bolt, one way to approach this is by using segments that mimic the typical zigzag pattern of lightning. This pattern generally consists of sharp angles and abrupt direction changes. Below, I'll provide a Python function that generates such a trajectory.

### Trajectory Decision:
The trajectory is **open**, as it represents a lightning bolt, which typically starts at a point and ends at another without looping back.

### Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:
1. Start at a point, move diagonally downwards to the right.
2. Turn sharply to the left and move diagonally upwards.
3. Turn sharply to the right and move horizontally.
4. Turn downwards to finish the bolt shape.

### Trajectory Analysis:
We'll break the bolt into three segments for simplicity. Assume `t` ranges from 0 to 1, changing uniformly over time.

### Mathematical Functions:
In the provided Python function, we've divided the lightning bolt into three linear segments. Each segment represents a different part of the lightning bolt.

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    if t < 0.33:  # First segment
        # Start: (0, 0), End: (1, -1)
        start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y = 0, 0, 1, -1
        x = start_x + (end_x - start_x) * (t / 0.33)
        y = start_y + (end_y - start_y) * (t / 0.33)
    elif t < 0.66:  # Second segment
        # Start: (1, -1), End: (0, 1)
        start_x, start_y = 1, -1
        end_x, end_y = 0, 1
        x = start_x + (end_x - start_x) * ((t - 0.33) / 0.33)
        y = start_y + (end_y - start_y) * ((t - 0.33) / 0.33)
    else:  # Third segment
        # Start: (0, 1), End: (2, 0.5)
        start_x, start_y = 0, 1
        end_x, end_y = 2, 0.5
        x = start_x + (end_x - start_x) * ((t - 0.66) / 0.34)
        y = start_y + (end_y - start_y) * ((t - 0.66) / 0.34)
        
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 1)
```

### Explanation:
- The trajectory uses three segments to mimic the zigzag pattern of a typical lightning bolt.
- The function smoothly transitions between each segment by using linear interpolation.
- For uniform movement, each segment receives a proportional section of `t`.
- Start and end coordinates are specified for each segment to ensure continuity.

**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open. So, avoid using a closed trajectory for an open path like S, a common error is to make it like shape 8.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:

6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments.

"I want to draw a Description = 'SnakeTrajectory: using a continuous trajectory that resembles a snake.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To represent a snake-like trajectory using a continuous curve, we'll create a smooth, wavy path typical of a snake's movement. This path will be open, as snakes generally move forward rather than in closed loops.

### Trajectory Analysis:
Given the nature of a snake's movement, we can achieve this effect using a sinusoidal wave, which inherently resembles the undulating motion of a snake. As the snake advances horizontally, it moves in a sine-wave pattern vertically.

### Mathematical Functions:
We'll use the sine function to create the vertical oscillation while maintaining forward motion in the horizontal direction. For simplicity and to ensure a uniform speed, the x-coordinate will advance linearly, and the y-coordinate will oscillate.

Here is the code to generate this snake-like trajectory:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Use a simple sinusoidal wave to emulate a snake-like trajectory
    # x increases linearly while y oscillates in a sine wave pattern
    x = t
    y = 5 * np.sin(t * 2 * np.pi / 10)  # Amplitude of 5 units, one cycle every 10 units
    
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t for an open trajectory
t_range = (0, 20)
```

### Explanation:
- **x = t**: The x-coordinate increases linearly, which moves the trajectory forward over time.
- **y = 5 * np.sin(t * 2 * np.pi / 10)**: The y-coordinate varies sinusoidally, creating a wave with an amplitude of 5 and a period corresponding to 10 units of t. This simulates the side-to-side slithering motion of a snake.
- **t_range = (0, 20)**: This interval generates a segment of the path, where t represents time or a similar parameter, defining the snake's forward motion and its oscillation pattern.

This code generates a smooth and continuous snake-like trajectory without abrupt changes, ensuring an open path aligned to the described motion.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Spiral: using a trajectory that forms a spiral starting from the center and moving outward.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To implement a spiral trajectory starting from the center and moving outward, we will use a polar coordinate system where the radius gradually increases as the angle increases. This can be achieved using the following parametric equations for a spiral:

- \(x(t) = (a + b \cdot t) \cdot \cos(t)\)
- \(y(t) = (a + b \cdot t) \cdot \sin(t)\)

where:
- \(a\) is the initial radius.
- \(b\) controls the increase in radius per unit angle.

The trajectory is open since a spiral typically does not loop back on itself unless specified explicitly. We'll ensure the trajectory is smooth by uniformly changing both x and y over time.

Let's implement this in `shape_curve(t)`:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Constants defining the spiral
    a = 0  # Initial radius
    b = 0.1  # Rate of spiral expansion
    
    x = (a + b * t) * np.cos(t)
    y = (a + b * t) * np.sin(t)

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (starting small can show the spiral better)
t_range = (0, 10 * np.pi)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Trajectory is Open:** A spiral trajectory is open as it starts from the center and moves outwards indefinitely.
2. **Equation Breakdown:**
   - We start with an initial radius \(a\).
   - The radius increases linearly with time, controlled by parameter \(b\), as \(b \cdot t\).
3. **Uniform Change Over Time:** The x and y coordinates change uniformly as \(t\) increases, ensuring smooth transitions through consistent growth of both coordinates.
4. **Range of \(t\):** We define a range for \(t\) from 0 to \(10\pi\) to produce a noticeable spiral pattern. This can be adjusted according to the desired length of the spiral.

"I want to draw a Description = 'Semicircle: using a trajectory that forms a half-circle.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To address the description given, we need to create a trajectory that forms a semicircle. This trajectory will be an open curve since a semicircle is not a closed figure. Here's how we can express this mathematically and in code:

**Trajectory Analysis:**

1. **Open Trajectory Decision:** Since the description asks for a semicircle, the trajectory is open.

2. **Trajectory Specification:** A semicircle can be represented by a segment of a circle. For simplicity, let’s consider a semicircle in the x-y plane, centered at the origin, and extending horizontally from -R to R. We'll choose the upper half of the circle.

3. We can use parametric equations to represent the semicircle trajectory:
   - \( x(t) = R \cdot \cos(t) \)
   - \( y(t) = R \cdot \sin(t) \)
   - Where \( t \) ranges from 0 to \( \pi \) to cover the semicircle.

4. We assume a uniform speed in tracing this semicircle, which means the parameter \( t \) will change linearly between the start and end values.

Here's the specific code to create a semicircle trajectory:

```python
import math

def shape_curve(t):
    R = 1  # Radius of the semicircle, adjust as needed
    x = R * math.cos(t)
    y = R * math.sin(t)
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t to cover the semicircle (from 0 to π radians)
t_range = (0, math.pi)
```

This code snippet will generate the (x, y) coordinates for a semicircle with a radius of 1. The parameter \( t \) will range from 0 to \( \pi \), which covers the upper half of the circle, thus forming a semicircle.

"I want to draw a Description = 'Arrow: using a trajectory that forms an arrow shape with a straight line and a triangular head.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To draw the trajectory of an arrow shape, we need to represent it with a straight line for the shaft and a triangular head. This is an open trajectory since it does not loop back to the start.

### Trajectory Analysis:
1. **Straight Line (Shaft):** This will be a horizontal line.
2. **Triangular Head:** This will involve two angled lines coming out from the end of the shaft forming a triangle shape with the base of the triangle aligned with the continuation of the shaft.

### Trajectory Breakdown:
- Start from `(0, 0)`, move right to `(1, 0)` for the shaft.
- Turn upwards to form a diagonal reaching up to the tip of the triangle at `(1.5, 0.5)`.
- Connect diagonally back down to `(2, 0)` to complete the head of the arrow.

### Ensuring Continuity:
- Segment 1: Horizontal line for the shaft.
- Segment 2: Diagonal from end of the shaft to the upper tip of the triangle.
- Segment 3: Diagonal back to complete the triangle.

Let's define this mathematically with continuity and uniform changes:

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    if 0 <= t < 1:
        # Shaft: Horizontal line (0 <= t < 1)
        x = t
        y = 0
    elif 1 <= t < 1.5:
        # Triangle head - diagonal upward line (1 <= t < 1.5)
        start_x, start_y = 1, 0  # Starting at end of shaft
        end_x, end_y = 1.5, 0.5  # Tip of the arrow
        x = start_x + (end_x - start_x) * (t - 1)
        y = start_y + (end_y - start_y) * (t - 1)
    elif 1.5 <= t <= 2:
        # Triangle head - diagonal downward line (1.5 <= t <= 2)

**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open. So, avoid using a closed trajectory for an open path like S, a common error is to make it like shape 8.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.
Emphasize once again: To ensure a smooth transition, you need to adjust the formulas for each segment so that they start from the endpoint coordinates of the previous segment, rather than independently redefining ( x ) and ( y ). If there are multiple segments, the starting and ending coordinates for each segment should be clearly marked in the comments as **start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y**.

"I want to draw a Description = 'Ellipse: using a trajectory that forms an elongated circle, or oval shape.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: Certainly! The description indicates that we want to draw an ellipse, which is a closed trajectory since an ellipse is a continuous loop without an endpoint.

We'll create the mathematical representation for an ellipse trajectory using parametric equations. An ellipse centered at the origin with a semi-major axis \( a \) and a semi-minor axis \( b \) can be represented as:
\[ x = a \cdot \cos(t) \]
\[ y = b \cdot \sin(t) \]

For a smooth and continuous ellipse, the parameter \( t \) represents the angle in radians, typically ranging from 0 to \( 2\pi \).

Here's the corresponding Python code:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Parameters for the ellipse
    a = 5  # semi-major axis length
    b = 3  # semi-minor axis length
    
    # Parametric equations for the ellipse
    x = a * np.cos(t)
    y = b * np.sin(t)
    
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (full ellipse cycle)
t_range = (0, 2 * np.pi)
```

This code snippet defines a function `shape_curve(t)` that returns the x and y coordinates of a point on the ellipse based on the parameter \( t \). The semi-major axis \( a \) is set to 5 units, and the semi-minor axis \( b \) is set to 3 units, forming an elongated circle—a classic ellipse. The function is ready to be used over the specified range of \( t \).
extracted_code: import numpy as np

    # Parameters for the ellipse
    a = 5  # semi-major axis length
    b = 3  # semi-minor axis length

    x = a * np.cos(t)
    y = b * np.sin(t)

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Square: using a square trajectory with a return to the origin.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To create the trajectory for a square with a return to the origin, it's important to ensure that the trajectory is closed, as it forms a complete geometric shape. We'll break down the path into four straight segments representing the sides of the square and return to the starting point, ensuring smooth transitions between each segment.

### Closed Trajectory Decision:
Since the description specifies a square and mentions a return to the origin, it indicates a closed trajectory.

### Trajectory Extraction (Detailed Breakdown):
1. Start at the origin (0, 0).
2. Move right along the x-axis.
3. Move up parallel to the y-axis.
4. Move left along the x-axis.
5. Move down back to the starting point (0, 0).

### Trajectory Analysis:
Each side of the square will have a constant length, and the transitions will ensure that the path forms a continuous loop (no jumps). Assume the square's side is of unit length for simplicity.

### Mathematical Functions Code:
Here's the Python function to describe this trajectory. We'll assign different segments of time to each movement to ensure smooth transitions and consistent speed, marking the starting and ending points of each segment.

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    # A unit square trajectory
    side_length = 1
    
    if 0 <= t < 1:
        # Move from (0, 0) to (1, 0)
        start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y = 0, 0, side_length, 0
        x = start_x + (end_x - start_x) * t
        y = start_y
        
    elif 1 <= t < 2:
        # Move from (1, 0) to (1, 1)
        start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y = side_length, 0, side_length, side_length
        x = start_x
        y = start_y + (end_y - start_y) * (t - 1)
        
    elif 2 <= t < 3:
        # Move from (1, 1) to (0, 1)
        start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y = side_length, side_length, 0, side_length
        x = start_x - (start_x - end_x) * (t - 2)
        y = start_y
        
    elif 3 <= t < 4:
        # Move from (0, 1) to (0, 0)
        start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y = 0, side_length, 0, 0

    return x, y

t_range = (0, 4)

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Inverse_N: using a trajectory of an inverse 'N' shape.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To draw the trajectory of an inverse 'N' shape, we can break it down into straightforward linear segments. An inverse 'N' shape consists of a diagonal line ascending from a point on the left to a point on the right, followed by a vertical line descending to another point directly below the starting point. Since this is an open path and follows a simple geometric pattern, we don't need a detailed trajectory breakdown. Here's how you can define it:

### Trajectory Analysis:
1. **Segment 1 (Diagonal Up-Right):** Start from the bottom-left, move diagonally upwards to the top-right.
2. **Segment 2 (Vertical Down):** From the endpoint of segment 1, move vertically downwards to complete the inverse 'N'.

### Code Implementation:
The simplest approach is to use two segments, and ensure continuity by starting each new segment where the previous one left off.

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y = 0, 0, 1, 1
    if 0 <= t < 0.5:
        # First segment: diagonal line from (0, 0) to (1, 1)
        # Parametrization for the first half
        x = start_x + (end_x - start_x) * (t / 0.5)  # Varies from 0 to 1
        y = start_y + (end_y - start_y) * (t / 0.5)  # Varies from 0 to 1
    elif 0.5 <= t <= 1:
        # Second segment: vertical line from (1, 1) to (1, 0)
        # Reset start_x, start_y to new segment's start (1, 1)
        start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y = 1, 1, 1, 0
        # Parametrization for the second half
        x = start_x  # Constant at 1
        y = start_y + (end_y - start_y) * ((t - 0.5) / 0.5)  # Varies from 1 to 0

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 1)
```

In this implementation:
- The parameter `t` is divided into two segments [0, 0.5) and [0.5, 1].
- The function calculates `(x, y)` positions continuously across both segments without jumps.
- Uniform speed is ensured by linear interpolation within the defined segments.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = '3dots: using a trajectory that passes through three specific points not in a straight trajectory.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: Based on the description "3dots: using a trajectory that passes through three specific points not in a straight trajectory," let's break down the task:

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Since the task involves starting from one point, passing through two others, and not forming a straight line between them, this suggests an open trajectory. 

2. **Trajectory Analysis:** With three specified points not forming a straight line, we'll create a smooth curve, such as a parabola or a similar arc, that passes through these points.

Given these points, I will create a smooth, continuous trajectory. We can use an arc to guide our curve through the three points: \(P_1\), \(P_2\), and \(P_3\). For simplicity, assume the points are:

- \(P_1 = (0, 0)\)
- \(P_2 = (2, 1)\)
- \(P_3 = (4, 0)\)

I'll write the code for a trajectory using a quadratic Bezier curve, which naturally passes through the start and endpoint, with the middle point defining the "peak" or "depth" of the curve.

### Mathematical Functions:

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    # Points coordinates
    P1 = (0, 0)
    P2 = (2, 1)
    P3 = (4, 0)
    
    # Calculate the Bezier curve
    x = (1-t)**2 * P1[0] + 2*(1-t)*t * P2[0] + t**2 * P3[0]
    y = (1-t)**2 * P1[1] + 2*(1-t)*t * P2[1] + t**2 * P3[1]
    
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 1)
```

In this representation, \(t\) ranges from 0 to 1, where:

- \(t = 0\) gives us the starting point \(P_1\),
- \(t = 1\) gives us the ending point \(P_3\),
- \(t = 0.5\) or other intermediate values would give us points lying on the curve, ensuring it passes closely through \(P_2\).

This function generates a smooth trajectory that is easy to adjust for different points and respects the open nature of the shape requested.

**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open. So, avoid using a closed trajectory for an open path like S, a common error is to make it like shape 8.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.
Emphasize once again: To ensure a smooth transition, you need to adjust the formulas for each segment so that they start from the endpoint coordinates of the previous segment, rather than independently redefining ( x ) and ( y ). If there are multiple segments, the starting and ending coordinates for each segment should be clearly marked in the comments as **start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y**.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'SDF: using a straight trajectory.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: Based on the description provided, "SDF: using a straight trajectory" implies that the trajectory is open, as it attempts to form letters rather than a closed shape.

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory is open because we are forming letters.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:** Since the description indicates straight trajectories forming the letters "SDF," it involves a sequence of straight line segments. We will translate these letters into straight segments.

   - For an "S," start at a point, move in an arc shape downward, back, and then forward.
   - For a "D," start up, curve to form a semi-circle to the right, and return to the start.
   - For an "F," trace upwards, then horizontally to the right, and then partway down.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** We will assume each letter is constructed with straight line paths for simplicity, without refined curves, forming an "S," then a "D," and lastly an "F."

Below is the simplified representation of the described letters using straight trajectories:

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    import numpy as np
    
    # Parameters to define the size and separation of each letter's drawing
    segment_length = 1.0
    separation = 0.5
    num_letters = 3
    
    # Total number of segments: S(3) + D(4) + F(3) = 10
    total_segments = 10
    segment_time = 1.0 / total_segments
    
    # Initialize x, y
    x, y = 0.0, 0.0
    
    # Determine the position along the trajectory
    if 0 <= t < segment_time * 3:  # "S"
        if 0 <= t < segment_time:
            x = t * segment_length * 3
            y = 0
        elif segment_time <= t < segment_time * 2:
            x = segment_length
            y = (t - segment_time) * segment_length * 3
        elif segment_time * 2 <= t < segment_time * 3:
            x = segment_length - (t - segment_time * 2) * segment_length * 3
            y = -segment_length
    elif segment_time * 3 <= t < segment_time * 7:  # "D"
        if segment_time * 3 <= t < segment_time * 4:
            x = segment_length * separation
            y = -(t - segment_time * 3) * segment_length * 2
        elif segment_time * 4 <= t < segment_time * 6:
            x = segment_length * separation + (t - segment_time * 4) * segment_length * 2
            y = -segment_length
        elif segment_time * 6 <= t < segment_time * 7:
            x = segment_length * separation + segment_length
            y = -(segment_length - (t - segment_time * 6) * segment_length * 2)
    elif segment_time * 7 <= t < segment_time * 10:  # "F"
        if segment_time * 7 <= t < segment_time * 8:
            x = segment_length * separation * 2
            y = -(t - segment_time * 7) * segment_length * 2
        elif segment_time * 8 <= t < segment_time * 9:
            x = segment_length * separation * 2 + (t - segment_time * 8) * segment_length
            y = -segment_length
        elif segment_time * 9 <= t < segment_time * 10:
            x = segment_length * separation * 2
            y = -(segment_length - (t - segment_time * 9) * segment_length)
    
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
t_range = (0, 1)
```

This function, `shape_curve(t)`, models the trajectory for an "SDF" using straight segments, assuming a uniform movement over time specified by `t`. Each part of the trajectory smoothly transitions into the next, with a separation between the letters for clarity.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Zigzag: using a zigzag trajectory.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To draw a zigzag trajectory, we will design a piecewise linear path that alternates direction at regular intervals. The trajectory will be open since a zigzag pattern does not typically close back on itself. Here’s how to break down and compute the zigzag trajectory:

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** This trajectory is open.

2. **Trajectory Analysis:**
   - We'll create a zigzag pattern by alternating between forward and sideways movements.
   - Each segment of the zigzag will have equal length, creating a uniform pattern.

3. **Mathematical Functions:**

We'll define the trajectory in pieces, moving alternately right and left from a center line:

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    # Determine the number of zigzag segments
    n_segments = 10  # adjust as needed for more zigzags
    segment_length = 1  # length of each zigzag segment
    segment_time = (1.0 / n_segments)

    # Determine which segment we are in
    current_segment = int(t / segment_time)
    
    # Base coordinates
    base_x = (current_segment + 0.5) * segment_length
    base_y = 0

    if current_segment % 2 == 0:
        # Even segments go upward diagonally
        x = base_x + (t % segment_time) * segment_length / segment_time
        y = (t % segment_time) * segment_length / segment_time
    else:
        # Odd segments go downward diagonally
        x = base_x + (t % segment_time) * segment_length / segment_time
        y = segment_length - (t % segment_time) * segment_length / segment_time

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
t_range = (0, 1)
```

- In this setup:
  - `n_segments` controls how many zigzag pieces there are.
  - `segment_length` sets the size of each segment.
- The trajectory functions ensure smooth transitions with consistent speed by determining the current segment based on `t` and then calculating `x` and `y` within each segment.
- This piecewise linear function loops through zigzag segments, alternating direction for each new segment.

Feel free to adjust the `n_segments` and `segment_length` variables to match the specific needs of the zigzag you'd like to create.
extracted_code: def shape_curve(t):
    # Determine the number of zigzag segments
    n_segments = 10  # adjust as needed for more zigzags

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = '135angleLeft: moving forward and then making a 135-degree turn to the left.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To draw the described trajectory, let's analyze it in steps before writing the code. The person first moves forward, then makes a 135-degree turn to the left from their initial direction and continues moving.

**Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:**
- The trajectory described is open, as it involves a forward movement and a turn, without closing back on itself.

**Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
1. Walk forward for a certain distance (let's say 10 units).
2. Make a 135-degree turn to the left.
3. Continue walking straight for the same distance after the turn.

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- Since an exact distance isn't provided, let's assume the forward movement is a straight line of length 10 units.
- After this, making a 135-degree turn to the left can be visualized as moving in a new direction, which is substantially different from a simple 90-degree or 180-degree turn.

**Mathematical Functions:**
We'll define the trajectory for `t` between 0 and 2, where:
- For 0 <= t < 1, the person moves forward.
- For 1 <= t <= 2, the person makes a 135-degree turn to the left and continues to walk.

Here's the enclosed mathematical function using linear algebra concepts:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Initial forward movement path
    if 0 <= t < 1:
        # Start at (0,0) and move forward 10 units to (10,0)
        x = 10 * t
        y = 0
        start_x, start_y = 0, 0
        end_x, end_y = 10, 0
    # 135-degree turn to the left
    elif 1 <= t <= 2:
        # Continue from the end of the first segment (10,0) onward
        angle_radians = np.radians(135)
        # Move in the new direction with coordinates adjusted by the angle
        x = 10 + 10 * (t-1) * np.cos(angle_radians)
        y = 10 * (t-1) * np.sin(angle_radians)
        start_x, start_y = 10, 0
        end_x = 10 + 10 * np.cos(angle_radians)
        end_y = 10 * np.sin(angle_radians)

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
t_range = (0, 2)
```

This function ensures smooth transitions between segments and uniform movement in time (`t`). The trajectory path starts from `(0,0)`, moves to `(10,0)`, then makes a 135-degree turn to the left, moving to `(10 + 10 * cos(135°), 10 * sin(135°))` by the end of `t = 2`. The coordinates remain continuous at each transition point.

**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open. So, avoid using a closed trajectory for an open path like S, a common error is to make it like shape 8.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.
Emphasize once again: To ensure a smooth transition, you need to adjust the formulas for each segment so that they start from the endpoint coordinates of the previous segment, rather than independently redefining ( x ) and ( y ). If there are multiple segments, the starting and ending coordinates for each segment should be clearly marked in the comments as **start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y**.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = '120angleRight: moving forward and then making a 120-degree turn to the right.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To represent the described trajectory of moving forward and then making a 120-degree turn to the right, we need to follow these steps:

### Closed or Open Trajectory Decision
This trajectory is open because the path doesn't return to its starting point after the turn.

### Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown
1. Start moving forward in a straight line.
2. After a certain distance, make a 120-degree turn to the right.
3. Continue moving forward.

### Trajectory Analysis
To ensure a smooth trajectory, we need to express each segment in terms of mathematical functions and describe transitions neatly:
- The first segment is a straight line moving forward.
- The second segment involves a 120-degree right turn and continuing in a straight line.

For simplicity, let's assume:
- The first segment occurs over `0 <= t < 5` and moves straight along the x-axis.
- The second segment occurs over `5 <= t <= 10` and continues by turning 120 degrees to the right from the initial forward direction.

Here is the code implementing the trajectory:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    if 0 <= t < 5:
        # Starting from origin, moving forward
        # Constant forward movement in a straight line on the x-axis
        start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y = 0, 0, 5, 0
        x = t
        y = 0
    elif 5 <= t <= 10:
        # Continuing with 120-degree turn to the right
        # Turning right rotates the direction counter to normal trigonometric rotation
        start_x, start_y = 5, 0
        x = 5 + (t - 5) * np.cos(np.deg2rad(-120))  # Correct turn
        y = (t - 5) * np.sin(np.deg2rad(-120))
    else:
        x, y = None, None  # If t is outside the specified range

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 10)
```

### Explanation: 

In this code:
- For `0 <= t < 5`, the person walks forward in a straight line.
- For `5 <= t <= 10`, the person makes a right turn of 120 degrees and continues moving in a straight line.
- The continuity of the path is ensured by updating the starting point of the second segment to align with the end of the first segment.
- Note that `np.deg2rad(-120)` is used to convert the 120-degree right turn to radians, and the use of negative is appropriate for a rightward direction.

This simplified approach ensures the described trajectory, executed at a uniform pace.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = '110angleRight: moving forward and then making a 110-degree turn to the right.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To draw the described trajectory of moving forward and then making a 110-degree turn to the right, we need to break it down into two segments: a straight path followed by a turn.

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:**  
   This is an open trajectory because it involves a straight path and a turn without returning to the starting point.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**  
   - **Segment 1:** Walk forward in a straight line.
   - **Segment 2:** Turn 110 degrees to the right from the forward direction and continue in a straight line.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:**  
   The trajectory consists of two segments with smooth transitions without overlaps. The continuity ensures a seamless transition from the straight path to the right-turn path.

Let's assume the initial path is in the positive x-direction, and for simplicity, let's choose arbitrary distances (e.g., 5 units each segment). We'll use a parametric form for `t` to ensure even spacing and continuity:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    if 0 <= t < 0.5:  # Segment 1: Move forward in a straight line
        # Linear movement forward
        start_x, start_y = 0, 0
        end_x, end_y = 5, 0
        x = start_x + (end_x - start_x) * (t / 0.5)
        y = start_y + (end_y - start_y) * (t / 0.5)
    elif 0.5 <= t <= 1.0:  # Segment 2: Turn 110 degrees right and continue
        # Calculate turn (110-degree right turn)
        # This involves a turn to a new angle for the second segment
        angle_rad = np.radians(110)
        start_x, start_y = 5, 0
        end_x, end_y = 5 + 5 * np.cos(angle_rad), -5 * np.sin(angle_rad)
        x = start_x + (end_x - start_x) * ((t - 0.5) / 0.5)
        y = start_y + (end_y - start_y) * ((t - 0.5) / 0.5)
    else:
        raise ValueError("t should be in the range [0, 1]")

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
t_range = (0, 1)
```

In this code:
- For the first half of `t` (`0 <= t < 0.5`), the person moves forward along the x-axis.
- For the second half (`0.5 <= t <= 1.0`), the person turns 110 degrees to the right, continuing from their point at the end of the first segment.

Each segment is smoothly connected and ensures uniform speed across the whole trajectory. The coordinates transition smoothly between segments to maintain a continuous path.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = '90angleRight: moving forward and then making a 90-degree turn to the right.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To address the task, let's break down the description of the trajectory and convert it into a mathematical representation suitable for a function.

### Trajectory Analysis and Breakdown:

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:**
   - This trajectory is open because it starts with moving forward and then turns 90 degrees to the right without forming a closed loop.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
   - The description "90angleRight: moving forward and then making a 90-degree turn to the right" can be broken down as follows:
     - Move forward in a straight line.
     - At a certain point, turn 90 degrees to the right and continue in a new straight line.

3. **Mathematical Representation:**
   - Let's break it down into two segments:
     - **Segment 1:** Moving forward in the positive y-direction.
     - **Segment 2:** Turning 90 degrees right, then moving in the positive x-direction.
   - The movement is represented with two linear segments.

4. **Define the Range of `t`:**
   - We'll choose a range of `t` that divides the movement into two equal parts for simplicity.

Below is the Python code implementing the above trajectory:

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    if 0 <= t < 0.5:  # Segment 1: Moving forward
        # Start from (0, 0), end at (0, 1)
        x = 0
        y = 2 * t
    elif 0.5 <= t <= 1:  # Segment 2: 90-degree turn to the right
        # Start from (0, 1), end at (1, 1)
        x = 2 * (t - 0.5)
        y = 1
    else:
        raise ValueError("t should be within the range [0, 1].")

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
t_range = (0, 1)
```

### Explanation:
- **Segment 1 `(0 <= t < 0.5)`**: Move vertically up. The initial position is (0, 0), and it moves up to (0, 1). This is a straight line along the y-axis.
- **Segment 2 `(0.5 <= t <= 1)`**: After reaching (0, 1), the trajectory turns right towards the x-direction from (0, 1) to (1, 1), moving horizontally.

Each segment ensures a smooth transition with consistent speed, beginning where the previous segment ended. This implementation should correctly follow the described movement and avoid any abrupt changes or "jumps."

    if 0 <= t < 0.5:  # Segment 1: Moving forward

        y = 2 * t

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = '60angleRight: moving forward and then making a 60-degree turn to the right.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To address the given task, we need to determine whether the trajectory should be closed or open. Based on the description, it involves moving forward and then making a 60-degree turn to the right. This suggests an open trajectory as it does not mention returning to the starting point or forming a closed shape.

Let's break down the movement:

1. **Initial Movement**: Move forward in a straight line.
2. **Turning**: Make a 60-degree turn to the right.

Given this, we can create the function `shape_curve(t)` to represent this trajectory. We'll assume a simple forward movement followed by a 60-degree turn in a smooth arc.

Here's how to implement this in Python:

```python
import math

def shape_curve(t):
    # Define each segment of the trajectory        
    if t <= 1:
        # Forward movement for the first segment
        start_x, start_y = 0, 0
        end_x, end_y = t, 0
        x = start_x + (end_x - start_x) * t
        y = start_y + (end_y - start_y) * t
    else:
        # After t=1, start turning for the 60-degree arc
        start_x, start_y = 1, 0
        angle_rad = (t - 1) * math.pi / 3  # 60 degrees in radians
        radius = 1  # Assume a circular arc with radius 1
        end_x = start_x + radius * (1 - math.cos(angle_rad))
        end_y = start_y + radius * math.sin(angle_rad)
        x = start_x + (end_x - start_x)
        y = start_y + (end_y - start_y)

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
t_range = (0, 2)
```

### Explanation:

- **Segment 1**: From `t = 0` to `t = 1`, the path is a straight line moving forward. This is generated using a simple linear function where `x` moves from 0 to 1 while `y` remains constant.

- **Segment 2**: From `t = 1` onward, there's a smooth right turn of 60 degrees. The trajectory is defined using trigonometric functions to simulate the circular arc.

This trajectory is open, as it hasn't described a closed loop or return to the starting position. The variable `radius` was chosen for simplicity, assuming the forward motion unit is 1 (you can adjust the radius further if needed). The choice of `t_range` assumes uniform forward and then turning motion. Adjust as needed for more detailed movement.

def shape_curve(t):
    # Define each segment of the trajectory        
    if t <= 1:

**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open. So, avoid using a closed trajectory for an open path like S, a common error is to make it like shape 8.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.
Emphasize once again: To ensure a smooth transition, you need to adjust the formulas for each segment so that they start from the endpoint coordinates of the previous segment, rather than independently redefining ( x ) and ( y ). If there are multiple segments, the starting and ending coordinates for each segment should be clearly marked in the comments as **start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y**.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = '30angleLeft: moving forward and then making a 30-degree turn to the left.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: Based on the given description, the trajectory is open because it involves moving forward and turning without circling back to the starting point. Let's break down the trajectory:

1. **Initial Movement:** Move straight forward.
2. **Turn:** Make a 30-degree turn to the left and continue moving forward.

**Trajectory Analysis:**

- The movement begins with a straight path forward.
- After an initial period, a smooth transition occurs into a 30-degree left turn, continuing in this new direction.

Here's how we can express this motion mathematically:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Initial straight path
    if t <= t_turn:
        # Moving straight forward
        x = initial_v * t
        y = 0
    else:
        # After the 30-degree left turn
        delta_t = t - t_turn  # Time after the turn
        angle_rad = np.radians(30)  # Convert 30 degrees to radians
        x = initial_v * t_turn + turn_v * np.cos(angle_rad) * delta_t
        y = turn_v * np.sin(angle_rad) * delta_t
    
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
# Assuming the turn occurs at t = 1 for simplicity
initial_v = 1  # Initial velocity along the x-axis
turn_v = 1  # Velocity after the turn
t_turn = 1
t_range = (0, 3)
```

**Explanation:**

- **Initial Movement (`t <= t_turn`):** The person moves straight forward along the x-axis with a constant speed until time `t_turn`.
- **After 30-Degree Turn (`t > t_turn`):** The person makes a left turn and continues in a new direction at the same speed. The trajectory is adjusted by a 30-degree angle using trigonometric functions with the turn's velocity components: `cos(angle)` for x and `sin(angle)` for y.

This code assumes that the transition to the new direction happens at time `t_turn`, and the motion is continuous and smooth throughout the entire range of `t`.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = '30angleRight: moving forward and then making a 30-degree turn to the right.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To draw the described trajectory accurately, let's break down the movement and then provide the mathematical function:

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** This trajectory appears to be open since there is no mention of returning to the starting point or forming a loop.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
   - Start by moving straight forward.
   - After completing the forward segment, turn 30 degrees to the right and continue moving.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** The described movement involves two main parts: a straight line and then a turn followed by another straight segment. The trajectory will change direction by 30 degrees to the right after the initial forward movement.

4. **Mathematical Functions:** We will compose the function such that it incorporates both segments smoothly, ensuring a continuous trajectory with proper alignment at the transition point.

Here's how we can define this trajectory function:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    if t < 1:
        # First segment: move forward in a straight line
        # Starting point: (0, 0), Ending point: (5, 0)
        start_x, start_y = (0, 0)
        end_x, end_y = (5, 0)
        
        # Linear interpolation for x
        x = start_x + (end_x - start_x) * t
        y = start_y + (end_y - start_y) * t
    else:
        # Second segment: turn 30 degrees to the right and move forward
        # Starting point is the end of the first segment: (5, 0)
        start_x, start_y = (5, 0)
        angle_radians = np.radians(30)
        distance = 5 * (t - 1)  # Continue moving 5 more units after turning
        x = start_x + distance * np.cos(angle_radians)
        y = start_y + distance * np.sin(angle_radians)

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
# 0 <= t < 1 for the first segment, 1 <= t < 2 for the second segment
t_range = (0, 2)
```

- **Segment 1:** Moves forward in a straight line from (0, 0) to (5, 0) as \( t \) goes from 0 to 1.
- **Segment 2:** Takes a 30-degree right turn from the end of the first segment and moves to a new endpoint from \( t=1 \) to \( t=2 \).

This code ensures a smooth transition between the segments and a uniform speed of movement.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'CapitalJ: using a trajectory resembling the capital letter 'J'.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To create a trajectory resembling the capital letter 'J', we need to make sure that the path mimics the shape effectively. The letter 'J' comprises a straight vertical line followed by a smooth curve forming a hook. 

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:**
   - The trajectory for the letter 'J' is open because it does not return to its starting point.

2. **Trajectory Analysis:**
   - Start with a vertical line descending from the top.
   - Finish with a semi-circular curve at the bottom that forms the hook of the 'J'.

Here's how we can break down the shape:
- Move vertically downwards for the straight part of the 'J'.
- Form a quarter-circle for the hook at the bottom.

3. **Mathematical Functions:**
   - For the vertical line: This can be parameterized as moving along the y-axis for a range of t.
   - For the hook: A quarter-circle, which can be described using trigonometric functions.

Let's write the function `shape_curve(t)`:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    if t < 1.0:  # Vertical line part, t from 0 to 1
        # Linear equation for vertical line
        x = 0
        y = -(5 * t)  # Move downwards from 0 to -5 as t goes from 0 to 1
    else:  # Quarter-circle part, t from 1 to 2
        t = t - 1.0
        # Parametric equation for the quarter-circle
        x = 5 * np.sin(np.pi * t * 0.5)  # 0 to 5 as t goes from 0 to 1
        y = -5 + 5 * np.cos(np.pi * t * 0.5)  # Keep it continuous from -5 to -10

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 2)
```

In this code:
- For \(0 \leq t < 1\), we create the vertical line by keeping x constant and varying y linearly.
- For \(1 \leq t \leq 2\), the quarter-circle is generated using parametric equations based on sine and cosine to smoothly transition for the semicircular arc.
- The trajectory starts at (0, 0), transitions smoothly at (0, -5), and ends at approximately (5, -10) with the transition ensuring continuity and smoothness.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'CapitalL: using a trajectory resembling the capital letter 'L'.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To create a trajectory that resembles the capital letter 'L', we need an open path. The shape of the letter 'L' is formed by an initial vertical line followed by a horizontal line. Let's break down this movement into two segments:

1. **Vertical Segment:** Start vertically down.
2. **Horizontal Segment:** Move horizontally to the right.

Since this is a simple trajectory, we can directly provide the function without further breakdown. We will use parameter `t` such that it smoothly transitions from the vertical to the horizontal segment. 

In this scenario:
- The vertical segment goes from `(0, 0)` to `(0, -1)`.
- The horizontal segment goes from `(0, -1)` to `(1, -1)`.

Let's define this trajectory in code:

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    if 0 <= t < 0.5:
        # Vertical line: from (0, 0) to (0, -1)
        start_x, start_y = 0, 0
        end_x, end_y = 0, -1
        # Linear interpolation
        x = start_x
        y = start_y + (end_y - start_y) * (t / 0.5)
    elif 0.5 <= t <= 1:
        # Horizontal line: from (0, -1) to (1, -1)
        start_x, start_y = 0, -1
        end_x, end_y = 1, -1
        # Linear interpolation
        x = start_x + (end_x - start_x) * ((t - 0.5) / 0.5)
        y = start_y

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
t_range = (0, 1)
```

This function defines the letter 'L' trajectory:
- For `0 <= t < 0.5`, it draws the vertical line from `(0, 0)` to `(0, -1)`.
- For `0.5 <= t <= 1`, it draws the horizontal line from `(0, -1)` to `(1, -1)`.

The transition from vertical to horizontal is smooth, maintaining a consistent speed of movement.

**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open. So, avoid using a closed trajectory for an open path like S, a common error is to make it like shape 8.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.
Emphasize once again: To ensure a smooth transition, you need to adjust the formulas for each segment so that they start from the endpoint coordinates of the previous segment, rather than independently redefining ( x ) and ( y ). If there are multiple segments, the starting and ending coordinates for each segment should be clearly marked in the comments as **start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y**.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'CapitalU: using a trajectory resembling the capital letter 'U'.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: Based on the description, the trajectory resembles the capital letter 'U'. This means it's an open trajectory, as it starts from one end of the 'U' and ends at the other without closing the shape.

### Trajectory Analysis:

To create a 'U' shape, we need a curve at the bottom and two vertical lines reaching upwards:

1. **Starting Point**: Begin at the top-left of the 'U'.
2. **Vertical Downward Line**: Move downward.
3. **Bottom Curve**: Transition smoothly through a semicircular curve.
4. **Vertical Upward Line**: Move upward to end at the top-right of the 'U'.

### Mathematical Representation:

For the 'U' shape, we can consider combining linear functions for vertical lines and a semicircle function for the curve:

1. **First Segment** (downward vertical line):
   - Move from the top-left to the bottom-left.
2. **Second Segment** (semicircular bottom curve):
   - Transition from the left bottom to the bottom right in a semicircular fashion.
3. **Third Segment** (upward vertical line):
   - Move from the bottom-right upward to the top-right.

Below is the Python code that implements the above trajectory:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Determine the segment based on t value
    if 0 <= t < 1:
        # First Segment: Vertical downward line
        start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y = -1, 1, -1, -1
        x = start_x
        y = start_y - (start_y - end_y) * t
    elif 1 <= t < 2:
        # Second Segment: Semicircular bottom curve
        angle = np.pi * (t - 1)  # Ranges from 0 to pi
        radius = 1
        start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y = -1, -1, 1, -1
        x = start_x + radius * (1 + np.cos(angle))
        y = start_y + radius * np.sin(angle)
    elif 2 <= t <= 3:
        # Third Segment: Vertical upward line
        start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y = 1, -1, 1, 1
        x = start_x
        y = start_y + (end_y - start_y) * (t - 2)

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
t_range = (0, 3)
```

This code is structured to ensure smooth transitions between segments while maintaining a uniform trajectory speed. The `shape_curve(t)` function covers the continuous movement needed to draw the 'U' shape as described.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'CapitalV: using a trajectory resembling the capital letter 'V'.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To draw a trajectory that resembles the capital letter 'V', we need to visualize a simple open path that starts at one point, descends diagonally, and then ascends diagonally to another point, creating a 'V' shape.

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** 
   - The trajectory is open since we are creating the shape of the letter 'V', which does not connect back to the starting point.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:**
   - The path of 'V' involves two straight lines:
     1. A line descending to the right.
     2. A line ascending to the right.
   - This trajectory has no overlapping sections.
   
4. **Mathematical Functions:**
   - We will define a linear function for each segment and ensure continuity between these functions.

Let's define the piecewise function for the shape of a 'V':

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    if 0 <= t < 0.5:
        # From the start point to the middle of 'V', descending part
        start_x, start_y = 0, 0
        end_x, end_y = 1, -1
        x = (end_x - start_x) * (t / 0.5) + start_x
        y = (end_y - start_y) * (t / 0.5) + start_y
    elif 0.5 <= t <= 1:
        # From the middle of 'V' to the endpoint, ascending part
        start_x, start_y = 1, -1
        end_x, end_y = 2, 0
        x = (end_x - start_x) * ((t - 0.5) / 0.5) + start_x
        y = (end_y - start_y) * ((t - 0.5) / 0.5) + start_y

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
t_range = (0, 1)
```

**Explanation:**
- The trajectory is divided into two segments.
- **First Segment (0 <= t < 0.5):** It describes the descending part of the 'V'.
  - Starts at (0, 0) and ends at (1, -1).
- **Second Segment (0.5 <= t <= 1):** It describes the ascending part of the 'V'.
  - Starts at (1, -1) and ends at (2, 0).
- The function ensures there are smooth transitions between the segments, with each segment's start aligning with the previous end point.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'CapitalZ: using a trajectory resembling the capital letter 'Z'.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To represent the trajectory resembling the capital letter 'Z', we need to construct an open trajectory that consists of three linear segments. The first segment is a diagonal line moving from the top left to the bottom right, the second segment is a horizontal line moving to the left, and the third segment is another diagonal line from the bottom left to the top right.

**Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory is open because it represents the letter 'Z'.

**Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
1. Diagonally down and right.
2. Move straight left.
3. Diagonally up and right.

**Trajectory Analysis:**
1. First segment starts at the top-left point, moving diagonally to the bottom-right.
2. Second segment goes horizontally left.
3. Final segment rises diagonally towards the top-right.

Let's define the mathematical function in Python to represent this trajectory:

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    if 0 <= t < 1:
        # First segment: start at (0, 0) and move to (1, -1)
        start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y = 0, 0, 1, -1

        y = (end_y - start_y) * t + start_y
    elif 1 <= t < 2:
        # Second segment: move from (1, -1) to (0, -1)
        start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y = 1, -1, 0, -1
        x = (end_x - start_x) * (t - 1) + start_x
        y = start_y  # remains constant
    elif 2 <= t <= 3:
        # Third segment: move from (0, -1) to (1, 0)
        start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y = 0, -1, 1, 0
        x = (end_x - start_x) * (t - 2) + start_x

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Number0: using a trajectory resembling the number '0'.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To represent the trajectory resembling the number '0', we need to create an elliptical or circular path. The trajectory will be closed since the number '0' forms a loop. In this scenario, we can utilize parametric equations that produce a smooth circular shape.

Here's the code:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Define the radius of the circle
    a = 5  # Horizontal radius
    b = 10 # Vertical radius
    
    # Parametric equations for an ellipse
    x = a * np.cos(t)
    y = b * np.sin(t)

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t which represents the full loop of the number '0'
t_range = (0, 2 * np.pi)  # Full circle range
```

This code uses parametric equations for an ellipse, where `x = a * cos(t)` and `y = b * sin(t)` with `a` and `b` being the semi-major and semi-minor axes, respectively. The range of `t` is from `0` to `2π`, which completes one full loop, effectively drawing the shape of a '0'. Adjust `a` and `b` to change the proportions if necessary.

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open. So, avoid using a closed trajectory for an open path like S, a common error is to make it like shape 8.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.
Emphasize once again: To ensure a smooth transition, you need to adjust the formulas for each segment so that they start from the endpoint coordinates of the previous segment, rather than independently redefining ( x ) and ( y ). If there are multiple segments, the starting and ending coordinates for each segment should be clearly marked in the comments as **start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y**.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Number1: using a trajectory resembling the number '1'.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To represent the trajectory of the numerical digit "1", we will assume a vertical line, given the simplicity and the typical representation of the number "1".

**Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:**
The trajectory resembling the number "1" is an open trajectory.

Since this is a straightforward case of a vertical line, we can skip the detailed fixed format breakdown and move on to providing the trajectory function.

Let's design this as a simple linear vertical movement:

**Trajectory Analysis:**
1. Start at a lower point and move directly upwards.
2. We will represent the trajectory of the number "1" as a vertical line that ensures a consistent vertical increment over a specified range of `t`.

Here's the code that represents this trajectory:

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    # Linear vertical line representing the number "1"
    # Start at a point (x=0, y=-1) and go to (x=0, y=1)
    x = 0  # constant, as we are drawing a straight vertical line
    y = -1 + 2 * t  # the y-coordinate increases from -1 to 1 as t goes from 0 to 1

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 1)
```

This function `shape_curve(t)` will trace out a straight line upward along the y-axis, perfectly resembling the number "1". The `t` parameter ranges from 0 to 1, allowing for a smooth and uniform traversal of the trajectory.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Number7: using a trajectory resembling the number '7'.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: Based on the description, the trajectory is open because it resembles the number '7', which involves a vertical and horizontal line with a sharp corner. This is not a closed geometric figure since you don't end where you started.

Since the shape is simple, I'll skip the detailed breakdown and directly provide the code for the open trajectory:

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    # t is expected to range from 0 to 1 to cover the whole "Number 7" line.
    
    # Define the start and end points for the different segments of '7'
    
    # Start at the top left of "7"
    if t <= 0.5:
        # Horizontal top line (left to right)
        # The horizontal line from (0, 1) to (1, 1)
        # Horizontal movement
        x = t * 2  # From 0 to 1
        y = 1
    else:
        # Vertical downward line
        # The vertical line from (1, 1) to (1, 0)
        # Vertical movement
        x = 1
        y = 2 - t * 2  # From 1 to 0 (as t goes from 0.5 to 1)

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (important for an open trajectory)
t_range = (0, 1)
```

### Explanation:
- From `t = 0` to `t = 0.5`, the trajectory moves horizontally from `(0, 1)` to `(1, 1)`.
- From `t = 0.5` to `t = 1`, it moves vertically from `(1, 1)` downward to `(1, 0)`.

The entire trajectory smoothly connects as a representation of the number '7' without any jumps.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Number8: using a trajectory resembling the number '8'.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To create a trajectory resembling the number "8," we will design a closed-loop trajectory. This trajectory will have two loops, one on top of the other, similar to the figure-eight pattern.

**Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:**
The trajectory should be closed as it forms a continuous loop resembling the number "8" shape.

**Trajectory Analysis:**
The number "8" can be represented using circular or elliptical loops. We will use two loops for this design: one at the top and one at the bottom. We'll ensure these loops connect smoothly, avoiding any abrupt shifts.

**Mathematical Functions:**
We'll use a combination of circular functions to represent the trajectory. For simplicity and elegance, the parameter `t` will range from \(0\) to \(2\pi\) for each loop, creating a smooth figure-eight path.

**Final Code:**

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Top loop of the '8'
    if t <= np.pi:
        x = np.sin(t)
        y = np.cos(t)
    # Bottom loop of the '8'
    else:
        x = np.sin(t)
        y = -np.cos(t)
        
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t - it completes a full '8' shape
t_range = (0, 2 * np.pi)
```

This implementation uses parametric equations for a circle, offset and manipulated to form two loops, creating an '8' shape. The loops are smoothly connected at \(t = 0\) and \(t = \pi\), ensuring continuity and uniform motion across the trajectory.

def shape_curve(t):

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.
Emphasize once again: To ensure a smooth transition, you need to adjust the formulas for each segment so that they start from the endpoint coordinates of the previous segment, rather than independently redefining ( x ) and ( y ). If there are multiple segments, the starting and ending coordinates for each segment should be clearly marked in the comments as **start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y**.

**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open. So, avoid using a closed trajectory for an open path like S, a common error is to make it like shape 8.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Model: To translate the given description into a trajectory, we will define a set of linear movements with specific directions based on the clock positions. The description implies an open trajectory that sketches out three linear segments with two turns.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown and the function implementation:

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:**
   - The described trajectory is open because it involves a sequence of linear movements without circling back to the starting point.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
   - "Walk forward for a certain distance": This will be represented by a straight line segment.
   - "Turn towards 10 o'clock and continue walking": This represents a change in direction relative to the initial line.
   - "Turn towards 10 o'clock again and continue walking": Another change in direction with respect to the last segment.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:**
   - Assume each segment represents equal unit length for simplicity and uniform speed, and the angle for the 10 o'clock direction relative to the forward direction can be considered as approximately 150 degrees counter-clockwise.
   - Ensure continuity at each turn to have a smooth trajectory with no jumps.

Now, here's the function implementation:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Trajectory segments definition based on time t
    if 0 <= t < 1:
        # Initial straight line
        x = t
        y = 0
    elif 1 <= t < 2:
        # First turn towards 10 o'clock (relative angle of 150 degrees)
        start_x, start_y = 1, 0
        x = start_x + (t - 1) * np.cos(np.radians(150))
        y = start_y + (t - 1) * np.sin(np.radians(150))
    elif 2 <= t <= 3:
        # Second turn, again towards 10 o'clock from the new direction
        start_x = 1 + np.cos(np.radians(150))
        start_y = np.sin(np.radians(150))
        x = start_x + (t - 2) * np.cos(np.radians(150) * 2)
        y = start_y + (t - 2) * np.sin(np.radians(150) * 2)
    else:
        # Return None if t is outside of the specified range
        return None, None

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
t_range = (0, 3)
```

**Explanation:**

- The trajectory is divided into three segments, each defined over unit intervals of `t`.
- The function ensures each segment starts from the endpoint of the previous one, using trigonometric functions to calculate new `x` and `y` based on the given directions.
- Each directional turn is approximately 150 degrees from the direction of the previous segment to reflect the 10 o'clock position properly.
- The range of `t` is from 0 to 3, covering all parts of the open trajectory.

**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open. So, avoid using a closed trajectory for an open path like S, a common error is to make it like shape 8.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.

Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.
Emphasize once again: To ensure a smooth transition, you need to adjust the formulas for each segment so that they start from the endpoint coordinates of the previous segment, rather than independently redefining ( x ) and ( y ). If there are multiple segments, the starting and ending coordinates for each segment should be clearly marked in the comments as **start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y**.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Walk forward, and turn right and continue walking, and turn right and continue walking.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: Based on the description provided, the trajectory forms a simple square path as the person walks forward and makes two right turns, indicating a closed trajectory. There is no need for a complex breakdown since this is straightforward.

Let's break down the trajectory as follows:

1. **Initial Walk**: Walk forward in a straight line.
2. **First Turn**: Turn right and walk forward in a straight line.
3. **Second Turn**: Turn right again and walk forward in a straight line, completing the square path.

### Trajectory Analysis
- **Closed Trajectory**: We have a square because the person makes two 90-degree turns and continues walking.
- **Key Points**: The square's sides are all equal as the person walks equal distances after each turn.

Here's the code following the specified output requirements:

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    # Each side of the square corresponds to a certain range of 't'
    if 0 <= t < 1:
        # Move forward (right)
        x = t
        y = 0
        # Start (0, 0), End (1, 0)
    elif 1 <= t < 2:
        # Turn right and move forward (up)
        x = 1
        y = t - 1
        # Start (1, 0), End (1, 1)
    elif 2 <= t < 3:
        # Turn right and move forward (left)
        x = 3 - t
        y = 1
        # Start (1, 1), End (0, 1)
    elif 3 <= t <= 4:
        # Turn right and move forward (down)
        x = 0
        y = 4 - t
        # Start (0, 1), End (0, 0)

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
t_range = (0, 4)
```

This code defines a square trajectory, ensuring smooth transitions between each segment. The person's overall path forms a closed loop, tracing a square shape by making two right-angle turns and returning to the starting point. Each segment aligns with the preceding one for continuity.

**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open. So, avoid using a closed trajectory for an open path like S, a common error is to make it like shape 8.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Zigzag: using a zigzag trajectory.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To represent a zigzag trajectory, we need to draw a series of linear segments that alternate direction, forming a zigzag pattern. This pattern is open because it doesn't enclose an area like a shape would.

### Trajectory Analysis:
In a zigzag trajectory:
1. The movement alternates between two directions (e.g., left to right and right to left).
2. Each segment should maintain a uniform speed, implying constant x and y changes over time.

Here's the simplified trajectory breakdown for a zigzag pattern that consists of a few segments moving diagonally back and forth:

- Move diagonally up-right.
- Move diagonally down-right.
- Repeat the above pattern.

### Mathematical Representation:
We'll represent this pattern with a function \( \text{shape_curve}(t) \), ensuring smooth transitions and uniform speed throughout the trajectory.

### Code for Zigzag Trajectory:
```python
def shape_curve(t):
    # Define parameters for zigzag dimensions and frequency
    a = 10  # Amplitude of the zigzag
    b = 5   # Length of each zigzag segment
    
    # Choose frequency such that it completes one zig-zag pattern over 0 to 2pi
    frequency = 2  # Controls how many zigzags we have over a period

    # Calculate x and y based on t
    x = a * t
    y = b * (-1) ** int(t * frequency)

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t to cover several zigzag peaks and troughs
t_range = (0, 5)  # Alter this range to change the number of zigzag segments
```

### Explanation:
- **Amplitude (a):** Determines the horizontal spacing between peaks.
- **Length (b):** Defines the vertical height of each zigzag segment.
- **Frequency:** Determines how quickly the direction changes for the zigzag effect.

This code models a zigzag path using simple mathematical expressions, implementing uniform motion as \( t \) progresses. Adjust `a`, `b`, and `t_range` to adapt the trajectory's size and complexity.

    # Define parameters for zigzag dimensions and frequency

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = '135angleLeft: moving forward and then making a 135-degree turn to the left.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To achieve the described trajectory of "moving forward and then making a 135-degree turn to the left," we need to break down the movement into two segments: moving forward in a straight line and then turning 135 degrees to the left. This results in an open trajectory since the movement does not loop back to the starting point.

### Trajectory Analysis & Breakdown:
1. **Segment 1**: Move forward in a straight line.
2. **Segment 2**: Make a 135-degree turn to the left and continue in a straight line.

We need to ensure a continuous trajectory without abrupt transitions between segments. We'll use linear segments and adjust based on `t`.

### Mathematical Functions:

1. The first segment will be a linear path.
2. The second segment will involve a change in direction – specifically, a 135-degree turn to the left.

Here is the Python code implementing the described path:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    if t < 0.5:
        # First segment: moving forward
        start_x, start_y = 0, 0
        end_x, end_y = 10, 0  # Moving forward by 10 units
        x = start_x + (end_x - start_x) * (t / 0.5)
        y = start_y + (end_y - start_y) * (t / 0.5)
    else:
        # Second segment: turning 135 degrees to the left and then moving forward
        # 135 degrees left means 45 degrees below the horizontal on the left side (or equivalently -135 degrees from the positive x-axis)
        start_x, start_y = 10, 0
        angle = np.deg2rad(-135)
        # Calculating end position after 135 degree turn (assume 10 units again)
        dx, dy = 10 * np.cos(angle), 10 * np.sin(angle)
        end_x, end_y = start_x + dx, start_y + dy
        x = start_x + (end_x - start_x) * ((t - 0.5) / 0.5)
        y = start_y + (end_y - start_y) * ((t - 0.5) / 0.5)

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
t_range = (0, 1)
```

### Explanation:
- **Segment 1**: From `t = 0` to `t = 0.5`, the person moves forward in a straight line from (0, 0) to (10, 0).
- **Segment 2**: From `t = 0.5` to `t = 1`, the person turns 135 degrees to their left and continues moving forward to approximately (-3.07, -7.07).

This trajectory smoothly transitions between the two segments, maintaining uniform speed throughout.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = '90angleRight: moving forward and then making a 90-degree turn to the right.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To address this description, we need to create a trajectory where a person initially moves forward and then makes a 90-degree turn to the right. This produces an open trajectory that resembles an "L" shape.

Here’s how we can break down the movement:

1. **Initial Movement:** The person moves forward in a straight line.
2. **Turn:** After a certain distance, the person makes a 90-degree turn to the right.
3. **Second Movement:** Following the turn, the person continues to move in a straight line in the new direction.

Let's translate this into a mathematical function for `shape_curve(t)`. Assuming the initial movement is along the y-axis and the person starts at the origin (0,0), they move vertically before turning right to move along the x-axis.

**Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory is open because it does not loop back to the starting point.

**Trajectory Analysis:** The function accounts for two segments:
- First segment: A straight vertical path upward.
- Second segment: A straight rightward path following a 90-degree turn.

Now let's define the code for this trajectory:

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    if t < 0.5:
        # First segment (straight forward on the y-axis)
        start_x, start_y = 0, 0  # Starting point
        end_x, end_y = 0, 5      # End point after moving forward
        x = start_x
        y = start_y + (t / 0.5) * (end_y - start_y)
    
    else:
        # Second segment (turn and move on the x-axis)
        start_x, start_y = 0, 5  # Starting point after turn
        end_x, end_y = 5, 5      # End point after moving right
        x = start_x + ((t - 0.5) / 0.5) * (end_x - start_x)
        y = end_y

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (important for proper function)
t_range = (0, 1)
```

This function represents a movement starting from the origin, initially moving upward, then turning right. The speed is uniform throughout the trajectory, with `t` ranging from 0 to 1.
extracted_code: def shape_curve(t):
    if t < 0.5:

Emphasize once again: To ensure a smooth transition, you need to adjust the formulas for each segment so that they start from the endpoint coordinates of the previous segment, rather than independently redefining ( x ) and ( y ). If there are multiple segments, the starting and ending coordinates for each segment should be clearly marked in the comments as **start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y**.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = '30angleRight: moving forward and then making a 30-degree turn to the right.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To draw the described trajectory of moving forward and then making a 30-degree turn to the right, let's go through the process you've outlined:

### Trajectory Analysis

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision**: This is an open trajectory. The description specifies a forward movement followed by a turn, and there is no indication of returning to the starting point, forming a loop or closed path.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown**:
   - Move forward in a straight line: Let's assume the person moves forward for 10 meters.
   - Turn 30 degrees to the right and continue moving forward for another 10 meters.

3. **Trajectory Analysis**:
   - We will break down the trajectory into two segments: 
     - **Segment 1**: Moving straight forward.
     - **Segment 2**: Turning 30 degrees to the right and continuing to move forward.
   - We'll ensure that the transition between segments is smooth.

### Mathematical Functions

We'll use parametric equations to represent the x and y coordinates over time `t`. The movement is linear for both segments with the transition happening at `t=0.5`.

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Define initial position
    start_x, start_y = 0, 0

    # Trajectory parameters
    forward_distance = 10
    angle_radians = np.radians(30)

    if t < 0.5:
        # Segment 1: Moving Straight Forward
        ratio = t / 0.5  # Normalized time for the first segment
        x = start_x + forward_distance * ratio
        y = start_y
    else:
        # Segment 2: Turn 30 degrees to the right
        ratio = (t - 0.5) / 0.5  # Normalized time for the second segment
        start_x = forward_distance  # End of Segment 1
        start_y = 0                # End of Segment 1
        x = start_x + forward_distance * ratio * np.cos(angle_radians)
        y = start_y + forward_distance * ratio * np.sin(angle_radians)

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
t_range = (0, 1)
```

### Explanation

- **First Segment (0 <= t < 0.5)**: Moves forward in a straight line. The `x` coordinate increases linearly while the `y` coordinate remains unchanged.
  
- **Second Segment (0.5 <= t <= 1)**: After the first segment, the path turns 30 degrees to the right. The new direction is handled by computing the change in `x` and `y` using cosine and sine of 30 degrees, respectively.

We've ensured a seamless transition between the segments for smooth trajectory drawing, with consistent speed maintained throughout. The function is ready to use, and the range of `t` from 0 to 1 represents the full trajectory.

        ratio = t / 0.5  # Normalized time for the first segment
        x = start_x + forward_distance * ratio
        y = start_y

**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open. So, avoid using a closed trajectory for an open path like S, a common error is to make it like shape 8.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'As the obstacle approaches, he takes a quick side step to the left, maintaining his forward motion and arm extension to avoid the sphere.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To translate the described movement into a trajectory, we need to consider how the person moves. The description indicates a forward movement with an additional quick side step to the left. This translates into an initial straight path, a quick lateral movement (to the left), and then a continuation in the original direction.

Here's a breakdown of the trajectory:

1. **Open Trajectory Decision:** This path is open because it starts with forward motion and includes a lateral step without returning to the starting point.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
   - Move forward for a certain distance (let's call this segment 1).
   - Quickly side step to the left (segment 2).
   - Continue moving forward in the original direction (segment 3).

3. **Trajectory Analysis:**
   - The trajectory must smoothly connect: move forward, step left, and then continue forward.
   - We will ensure there are no abrupt changes by making smooth transitions between each segment.
   
4. **Mathematical Representation:**
   - For simplicity, we assume each segment takes an equal amount of time, and the sideways movement is a short step to the left.

Here's how you can represent this trajectory in Python code:

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    if 0 <= t < 1:
        # Segment 1: Move forward
        x = t * 5  # Moving forward while x increases linearly
        y = 0
    elif 1 <= t < 2:
        # Segment 2: Quick side step to the left
        x = 5  # Maintain x position
        y = -(t - 1) * 2  # Quick step to the left
    elif 2 <= t <= 3:
        # Segment 3: Continue forward in the original direction
        x = 5 + (t - 2) * 5  # Continue moving forward
        y = -2  # Maintain y position

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
t_range = (0, 3)
```

Notes:
- We use three segments, with `t` ranging from 0 to 3 to represent the entire movement.
- The speed is uniform within each segment, but with a quick direction switch in the second segment.
- `(x, y)` coordinates change smoothly over each segment of `t`, ensuring continuity between segments.
extracted_code: def shape_curve(t):
    if 0 <= t < 1:
        # Segment 1: Move forward
        x = t * 5  # Moving forward while x increases linearly

    elif 1 <= t < 2:
        # Segment 2: Quick side step to the left
        x = 5  # Maintain x position
        y = -(t - 1) * 2  # Quick step to the left

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'He performs a zigzag run, weaving left and right to avoid multiple obstacles, simulating dynamic movement with minimal pause.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To create a trajectory that represents a zigzag run with dynamic movement and minimal pause, we need to ensure the path alternates left and right while maintaining smooth transitions. This will result in an open zigzag pattern.

### Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:
Since the description involves weaving left and right and implies a progressing movement, it describes an open trajectory.

### Trajectory Analysis:
The path should zigzag back and forth with consistent speed, which means both x and y coordinates should change uniformly over time. The zigzag can be modeled with a periodic function, such as a sine wave, that shifts side to side while progressing forward.

### Mathematical Functions:
We'll use a sine function to simulate the zigzag motion from left to right. The y-coordinate will increase uniformly to depict forward movement, while the x-coordinate will oscillate according to the sine function to create the zigzag pattern.

Here's the ready-to-use implementation:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Define zigzag parameters
    amplitude = 5  # The maximum horizontal shift (zigzag width)
    frequency = 2  # Frequency of the zigzag turns
    
    # Calculate x and y based on a sinusoidal pattern
    x = amplitude * np.sin(frequency * t)
    y = t  # Constant forward movement
    
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 10)
```

- **Explanation:** 
  - The `x` coordinate varies sinusoidally, which creates the weaving left and right effect.
  - The `y` coordinate is linear in `t`, representing the consistent forward progression of the movement.
  - The parameters (`amplitude` and `frequency`) are adjustable according to how wide and frequently the zigzag should appear.
  
This function will generate a zigzag path with smooth transitions suitable for simulating dynamic movement as described.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'He leaps over the obstacle after the kicks, landing with a running start and continuing forward.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: Based on the given description, we need to represent a trajectory where a person combines leaping over an obstacle with a running start and then continues forward. This trajectory is an open path since there is no indication of it returning or looping back.

**Trajectory Analysis:**

1. **Leap Over Obstacle:** This action suggests a parabolic trajectory where the person is airborne, starting with a takeoff and ending with a landing.
2. **Running Start and Continue Forward:** After landing, the person continues to move forward in a straight line.

Considering these elements, we can approximate the trajectory with a parabolic curve for the leap and a linear path for the forward movement. Let's outline the sequence:

1. **Leap or Jump (Parabolic Trajectory):** The person jumps in a parabolic arc.
   - Starts on the ground, reaches a peak, and lands at a certain distance forward.
2. **Run Forward (Linear Trajectory):** After landing, the person continues to move forward in a straight line.

Now let's create the function `shape_curve(t)` that models this trajectory:

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    if t < 0.5:
        # Parabolic jump (from t=0 to t=0.5)
        # Let's assume the jump starts at (0, 0), reaches peak at (5, 5), and lands at (10, 0)
        # Parametric equation for a parabola: x = start_x + step_x*t, y = 4*peak_y*t*(1 - t)
        start_x, start_y = 0, 0
        peak_x, peak_y = 5, 5
        end_x, end_y = 10, 0
        x = start_x + (end_x - start_x) * t * 2  # multiply by 2 to complete in half time (t=0 to 0.5)
        y = 4 * peak_y * t * (1 - t) * 2  # similar scaling
    else:
        # Linear run (from t=0.5 to t=1)
        # Start after landing point (10, 0), continue to (20, 0)
        start_x, start_y = 10, 0
        end_x, end_y = 20, 0
        adjusted_t = (t - 0.5) * 2  # adjust t to span 0 to 1 for this segment
        x = start_x + (end_x - start_x) * adjusted_t
        y = start_y + (end_y - start_y) * adjusted_t

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
t_range = (0, 1)
```

### Explanation:

- **Parabolic Jump:** Uses a parametric equation for a parabola with a peak, scaled to complete in half the time range.
- **Linear Run:** Continues in a straight line from the landing point, scaling t for the latter half to ensure smooth transition.

This trajectory ensures a continuous, smooth path with consistent speed and direction throughout, as described.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'As he nears the obstacle, he performs a 360-degree spin to the side, smoothly continuing his run after the spin.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To represent the described trajectory, it involves a person running, performing a 360-degree spin, and then continuing in a linear direction. This trajectory is open, as it starts in one location and ends in a different one. Here’s how we can mathematically translate this description into the function `shape_curve(t)`:

### Trajectory Breakdown:

1. **Initial Straight Run**: This part can be a straight line.
2. **360-degree Spin**: This involves overlapping circular motion, which will be a circle in the trajectory function.
3. **Continuation of Run**: A straight line directly continuing from the spin.

### Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:

- **Open Trajectory**: The person’s starting and ending points are different, thus it is an open trajectory.

### Trajectory Analysis:

- **Initial Straight Run**: The person starts running in a straight line towards a specific direction. We'll assume a straightforward path for simplification.
- **360-degree Spin**: A complete circular motion. The trajectory would form a full circle.
- **Continuation of Run**: After the spin, continues running, making the trajectory open.

### Mathematical Representation:

We assume the person runs straight for 5 units, performs a circular spin for approximately one full circle, and then continues forward for another 5 units.

Here's the code representing the trajectory:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Phase 1: Initial Straight Run (0 <= t < 1)
    if 0 <= t < 1:
        # Straight line: x increases from 0 to 5, y stays 0
        x = 5 * t
        y = 0
        
    # Phase 2: 360-degree Spin (1 <= t < 3)
    elif 1 <= t < 3:
        # Full circle: Centered at (5,0), radius 1
        angle = (t - 1) * np.pi  # t transforms to go from 0 to 2*pi
        x = 5 + np.cos(angle)
        y = np.sin(angle)
        
    # Phase 3: Continue Straight Run (3 <= t <= 4)
    elif 3 <= t <= 4:
        # Continue going straight: x increases from 6 to 10, y stays 0
        x = 6 + 4 * (t - 3)
        y = 0
    
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
t_range = (0, 4)
```

### Notes:

- **Continuity**: Each segment continues from the end of the previous, ensuring smooth transitions.
- **Speed Consistency**: The movements have been parameterized such that speed along the path is uniform.
- **Time Parameterization**: The range of `t` is divided into segments for clear demarcation of actions.

**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open. So, avoid using a closed trajectory for an open path like S, a common error is to make it like shape 8.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.
Emphasize once again: To ensure a smooth transition, you need to adjust the formulas for each segment so that they start from the endpoint coordinates of the previous segment, rather than independently redefining ( x ) and ( y ).

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'He ducks down and slides on the ground under the obstacle, regaining balance to continue running after passing it.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To solve the problem of drawing the specified trajectory, we'll need to break down the movement into its core components. The action description involves a person sliding on the ground to pass under an obstacle and then regaining balance to continue running. This trajectory can be visualized as a dip in the path, signifying the ducking motion, followed by a return to normal height.

### Closed or Open Trajectory Decision

The trajectory is open because the person progresses forward without returning to the starting point.

### Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown

1. Start running forward.
2. Duck down and slide under the obstacle.
3. Regain balance after passing the obstacle.
4. Continue running forward.

### Trajectory Analysis

- The path primarily consists of a linear forward motion with a dip (slide) in the middle.
- Assume the slide causes a slight downward motion (y-axis changes) while the forward motion (x-axis increases).
- We'll aim for a smooth transition in the path.

### Mathematical Functions

The path will be modeled as a function of time `t`. We'll create a dip using a smooth curve such as a sine wave segment to represent the slide action.

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    if t < 5:
        # Running forward before the obstacle
        x = t
        y = 0
    elif 5 <= t < 10:
        # Sliding under the obstacle
        x = t
        y = -np.sin((t-5) * np.pi / 5)  # Creates a dip motion
    else:
        # Regaining balance and continuing running forward
        x = t
        y = 0

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
t_range = (0, 15)
```

### Explanation

- **Before the slide (0 ≤ t < 5)**: The person runs straight, so y = 0, and x increases linearly with t.
- **During the slide (5 ≤ t < 10)**: The sine function `-np.sin((t-5) * π / 5)` creates a smooth dip.
- **After the slide (t ≥ 10)**: The person finishes the slide and resumes normal running. The path returns to y = 0.

This model ensures smooth transitions between the movement stages, with consistent speed over time (`t`), as requested.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'After the backward jump, he regains his forward run, giving space for the obstacle to move past him before he resumes.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: Based on the description, we have a trajectory involving a backward jump followed by forward movement. This is clearly an open trajectory since it does not form a closed shape but instead describes a path with a clear start and end.

### Trajectory Breakdown:
1. **Backward Jump**: Move a short distance backward.
2. **Pause/Wait for the Obstacle**: A brief pause or movement to maintain position.
3. **Forward Run**: Move a greater distance forward after the obstacle passes.

### Trajectory Analysis:
- The trajectory can be broken down into three segments: backward movement, a pause, and forward movement.
- We'll consider `t` representing time, with uniform speed across each movement segment. 

Let's proceed with the code:

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    # Define the segments of the trajectory
    # Segment 1: Backward Jump (from t=0 to t=0.2)
    if 0 <= t < 0.2:
        start_x, start_y = 0, 0
        end_x, end_y = -1, 0  # move 1 unit back on x-axis
        proportion = (t - 0) / (0.2 - 0)
        x = start_x + proportion * (end_x - start_x)
        y = start_y + proportion * (end_y - start_y)

    # Segment 2: Pause/Wait (from t=0.2 to t=0.4)
    elif 0.2 <= t < 0.4:
        start_x, start_y = -1, 0
        end_x, end_y = -1, 0  # stay in the same position
        proportion = (t - 0.2) / (0.4 - 0.2)
        x = start_x + proportion * (end_x - start_x)
        y = start_y + proportion * (end_y - start_y)

    # Segment 3: Forward Run (from t=0.4 to t=1)
    elif 0.4 <= t <= 1:
        start_x, start_y = -1, 0
        end_x, end_y = 2, 0  # move 3 units forward on x-axis
        proportion = (t - 0.4) / (1 - 0.4)
        x = start_x + proportion * (end_x - start_x)
        y = start_y + proportion * (end_y - start_y)

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
t_range = (0, 1)
```

### Explanation:
- **Segment 1** is a linear backward jump taking the character 1 unit backward on the x-axis.
- **Segment 2** is a pause, keeping the character in the same position after the jump.
- **Segment 3** resumes a forward run past the starting position, displacing the character 3 units forward from their jump's endpoint, resulting in a net 2-unit forward run from the initial position.

In this solution, we maintain the requirement for smooth transitions and uniform speed throughout the trajectory segments.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Move in an "S" shape, alternating direction to curve around the obstacle, which maintains his forward momentum.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: Based on the description provided, the trajectory is an open trajectory. The "S" shape inherently does not enclose a space and resembles a winding path. This description suggests a smooth, continuous trajectory that changes direction in a curving manner to resemble the letter "S".

Let's analyze and break down this trajectory into a mathematical function:

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory is open as the path resembles an "S" shape, which does not close upon itself.

2. **Trajectory Analysis:** The shape moves in a sinusoidal manner, alternating directions to emulate the curves of an "S". The trajectory should smoothly transition each segment without abrupt jumps. We'll represent half of the "S" with a sinusoidal function over a selected interval, and another half in an opposite curve.

3. **Mathematical Functions:** We need to ensure continuity and uniform speed. For simplicity, we'll use a parametric equation to represent the "S" curve over a defined range of `t`.

Here's the function representing this trajectory:

```python
import math

def shape_curve(t):
    # Start (x, y) for t=0 is (0, 0)
    # We use a sinusoidal pattern to represent the "S" curve, adjust scale factors as necessary
    x = t
    y = math.sin(t)
    
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
t_range = (0, 4 * math.pi)
```

### Explanation:

- **Mathematical Representation:** The `x` value increases uniformly with `t`, ensuring forward momentum. The `y` value alternates direction using the sine function to create an "S" shape that curves smoothly.

- **Range of `t`:** We use `t_range = (0, 4 * math.pi)` to allow two full cycles of sine wave (representing a full "S"); `4π` provides a coherent path length that can represent the necessary oscillations for the "S" shape without truncating prematurely.

- **Smooth Transitions:** The function uses continuous sinusoidal waves, allowing for smooth, uninterrupted transitions with uniformly changing coordinates.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Step to the side with an additional high kick aimed at diverting the obstacle, then sidestep around it and continue forward.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To create a trajectory based on the description provided, let's break down the movement into simpler actions, analyze it, and represent it mathematically.

### 1. Closed or Open Trajectory Decision
This trajectory is likely an open path. The description involves a series of movements that proceed in one direction with sidestepping to navigate an obstacle and then continuing forward. It doesn't imply returning to the starting point.

### 2. Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown
Since the description involves different movements, a breakdown would be useful:

1. **Step to the side:** Move laterally to the right or left.
2. **High Kick:** Aimed at an obstacle, implies stationary or forward diagonal motion.
3. **Sidestep around it:** Move sideways to bypass an obstacle.
4. **Continue forward:** Proceed in the direction parallel to the original path.

We'll assume a representative direction based on typical interpretations:
- Side step to the left first (9 o'clock direction)
- High kick (stationary moment; moving diagonally)
- Sidestep around (continue side movement)
- Continue forward (directly ahead, 12 o'clock direction)

### 3. Trajectory Analysis
Each move is represented with a geometric path in this context, and they seamlessly transition without abrupt changes.

### 4. Mathematical Functions

Here is how you would represent this series of movements geometrically:

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    if 0 <= t < 1:
        # Step to the side (left)
        x = -t  # Moving left
        y = 0
    elif 1 <= t < 2:
        # High kick implies a diagonal stationary movement
        x = -1 + (t - 1) * 0.5  # Slight diag. forward
        y = (t - 1) * 0.5
    elif 2 <= t < 3:
        # Sidestep around (further to the side)
        x = -0.5 - (t - 2) * 0.5
        y = 0.5
    elif 3 <= t <= 4:
        # Continue moving forward
        x = -1
        y = 0.5 + (t - 3) * 1.0  # Moving forward
        
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (important)
t_range = (0, 4)
```

This function describes the trajectory by smoothly connecting each segment based on the described movements. The start and end coordinates for each segment are chosen to ensure continuity. The variable `t` acts as a time parameter to control the movement from one action to the next.

    if 0 <= t < 1:

**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open. So, avoid using a closed trajectory for an open path like S, a common error is to make it like shape 8.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.
Emphasize once again: To ensure a smooth transition, you need to adjust the formulas for each segment so that they start from the endpoint coordinates of the previous segment, rather than independently redefining ( x ) and ( y ). If there are multiple segments, the starting and ending coordinates for each segment should be clearly marked in the comments as **start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y**.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'a man is walking/runing, he tried to avoid a sphere in the middle'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: Based on the description, the trajectory of the person involves navigating around a spherical obstacle. This suggests a simple open trajectory where the person diverts slightly in one direction to go around the sphere and then returns to their original path.

### Closed or Open Trajectory Decision
The trajectory is **open** because the person starts on a path, deviates to avoid an obstacle, and then returns to the path rather than creating a closed loop.

### Trajectory Extraction and Analysis
Since the scenario involves avoiding a spherical obstacle, we can imagine the person starting straight, then curving around the sphere, and then returning to the original direction. The trajectory can be broken down into the following steps:

1. Walk straight towards the sphere.
2. Curve to the left to avoid the sphere.
3. Rejoin the original path.

### Mathematical Functions
We will model the trajectory with three segments:

1. **Segment 1 (Straight Path):** The person moves in a straight line until they start curving to avoid the sphere.
2. **Segment 2 (Curved Path):** The person makes a semi-circular path around the sphere.
3. **Segment 3 (Straight Path):** The person returns to their initial trajectory.

Let's define the trajectory using a smooth transition with the parameter \( t \).

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    if 0 <= t < 10:
        # Segment 1: Walk straight for 10 units
        x = 0
        y = t  # y increases linearly
    elif 10 <= t < 20:
        # Segment 2: Curve around the sphere (semi-circle)
        # Start: (0, 10), End: (0, 20)
        angle = np.pi * (t - 10) / 10  # angle goes from 0 to pi
        radius = 5
        x = radius * np.sin(angle)  # Curve to the left
        y = 10 + radius * (1 - np.cos(angle))  # ensure it continues from (0, 10)
    elif 20 <= t <= 30:
        # Segment 3: Continue walking straight after avoiding the sphere
        # Start from where the curve ended, which is (0, 20)
        x = 0
        y = 20 + (t - 20)  # Continue from y=20, move straight

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
t_range = (0, 30)
```

### Explanation
- The first segment extends from \( t=0 \) to \( t=10 \), where the person moves straight.
- From \( t=10 \) to \( t=20 \), the path curves in a semi-circular arc to the left to avoid the sphere.
- Finally, from \( t=20 \) to \( t=30 \), the person resumes their original path, moving straight again.

This function smoothly transitions through each segment, ensuring that the path is continuous and reflects a realistic motion for avoiding an obstacle.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'a man is walking/runing, he tried to avoid a sphere in the middle'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To model the trajectory of a man who is walking or running and trying to avoid a sphere in the middle, we can assume an open trajectory. The person approaches the sphere, deviates around it, and then continues in their original direction. Here's how we can break it down:

**Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:**
- The trajectory is open, as the person doesn't return to the starting point.

**Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
1. Walk straight towards the sphere.
2. Start detouring to the right when close to the sphere.
3. Curve around the sphere.
4. Return to the original straight path after passing the sphere.

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- We'll use a semi-circle to model the deviation around the sphere.
- Ensure the movement is smooth with consistent speed.

**Mathematical Functions:**

Here's the code to represent this trajectory:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Initial straight path towards the sphere
    if t < 1:
        # Start at (0, 0), end at (1, 0)
        x = t
        y = 0
    # Semi-circle to the right from (1, 0) avoiding the sphere
    elif 1 <= t < 2.5:
        # Start at (1, 0), end at (1, 1)
        angle = np.pi * (t - 1) # Angle for the semi-circle
        x = 1 + 0.5 * np.cos(angle) # Circle center at (1, 0.5)
        y = 0.5 * np.sin(angle)
    # Continue the original straight path after passing the sphere
    else:
        # Start at (1, 1), moving straight right

        y = 1

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t

```

### Explanation:
- **Phase 1 (0 ≤ t < 1):** The person walks straight towards the sphere along the x-axis.
- **Phase 2 (1 ≤ t < 2.5):** The person deviates in a semi-circle path to avoid the sphere.
- **Phase 3 (t ≥ 2.5):** The person continues walking in the original direction after avoiding the sphere.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'a man is walking/runing, he tried to avoid a sphere in the middle'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To create the trajectory for a person moving and avoiding a sphere in the middle, we'll first decide whether the trajectory is closed or open. Since the action involves navigating around an obstacle, the trajectory is open.

### Trajectory Analysis:
The person starts moving straight, approaches the sphere, curves around it, and continues straight. The path resembles an open curve with a detour to avoid the sphere.

### Trajectory Breakdown:
1. **Walk straight towards the sphere:** Move forward.
2. **Curve around the sphere:** Move in an arc to the left or right.
3. **Continue straight past the sphere:** Move forward again.

### Mathematical Representation:
We'll represent this motion with parameterized curves. Let's assume the sphere is in the middle at the origin, and the person starts at `(-10, 0)`, circles around `(-5, 5)`, and finishes at `(10, 0)`.

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Segment 1: Move towards the sphere (straight line)
    # Start: (-10, 0), End: (-5, 0)
    if 0 <= t < 1:
        start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y = -10, 0, -5, 0
        x = start_x + (end_x - start_x) * t
        y = start_y  # Constant y because it's a straight line

    # Segment 2: Curving around the sphere (arc)
    # Start: (-5, 0), End: (5, 0)
    elif 1 <= t < 2:
        start_angle, end_angle = 0, np.pi  # Radians for half-circle clockwise
        radius = 5
        angle = (end_angle - start_angle) * (t - 1) + start_angle
        x = radius * np.cos(angle) - 5  # Shifting the center left by 5
        y = radius * np.sin(angle)

    # Segment 3: Continue forward after the sphere (straight line)
    # Start: (5, 0), End: (10, 0)
    elif 2 <= t <= 3:
        start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y = 5, 0, 10, 0
        x = start_x + (end_x - start_x) * (t - 2)
        y = start_y  # Constant y because it's a straight line

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 3)
```

### Explanation:
- **Segment 1**: The person moves in a straight line from `(-10, 0)` to `(-5, 0)`.
- **Segment 2**: The person curves in a half-circle avoiding the sphere, centered at `(-5, 0)`, with a radius of `5`.
- **Segment 3**: The person straightens out again and continues moving from `(5, 0)` to `(10, 0)`.

The `t` range from `0` to `3` captures all three segments of the journey, with each segment having continuous transitions and uniform speed within its own scope. Adjustments are made to ensure smooth transitions between segments to maintain continuity.

So, avoid using a closed trajectory for an open path like S, a common error is to make it like shape 8.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.
Emphasize once again: To ensure a smooth transition, you need to adjust the formulas for each segment so that they start from the endpoint coordinates of the previous segment, rather than independently redefining ( x ) and ( y ). If there are multiple segments, the starting and ending coordinates for each segment should be clearly marked in the comments as **start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y**.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'a man is walking/runing, he tried to avoid a sphere in the middle'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To create a trajectory for a person walking and attempting to avoid a sphere in the middle, we'll develop an open path that visually resembles a gentle arc or curve, deviating slightly to the side before returning to the original path. This path represents the person circumventing the sphere.

**Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:**
The trajectory is open because it involves a person navigating around an obstacle rather than completing a closed loop.

**Extract the Trajectory Description:**
1. Start at the initial position.
2. Walk forward while gradually moving to the right to create an arc around the sphere.
3. After bypassing the sphere, return to the original path.

**Trajectory Analysis:**
Considering the need for a smooth transition and uniform speed, we divide the trajectory into three segments: straight, curved to avoid the sphere, and straight again. We ensure smoothness by aligning the end of one segment with the start of the next.

Let's code this using a piecewise function that blends linear and circular path elements. 

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    if t < 0.2:
        # Move in a straight line
        x = t * 5
        y = 0
    elif t < 0.8:
        # Curve to avoid the sphere, creating an arc
        theta = (t - 0.2) * np.pi  # Radians
        radius = 2
        x = 1 + radius * np.sin(theta)
        y = radius * (1 - np.cos(theta))
    else:
        # Resume straight line motion
        x = (t - 0.8) * 5 + 2
        y = 0

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 1)
```

**Explanation:**
- **Segment 1:** From `t=0` to `t=0.2`, the person walks in a straight line. The segment ends at (1, 0).
  
- **Segment 2:** From `t=0.2` to `t=0.8`, the trajectory becomes a half-circle arc around the hypothetical sphere, with the center of curvature offset to the left to create avoidance around the sphere. This ends at (2, 0).

- **Segment 3:** From `t=0.8` to `t=1`, the trajectory returns to straight motion, extending the path from the arc's endpoint.

The trajectory is continuous, ensuring smooth transitions between segments, providing an elegant maneuver around an obstacle. Adjust `start_value` and `end_value` in `t_range` to simulate different portions of the trajectory.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'a man is walking/runing, he tried to avoid a sphere in the middle'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: Based on the description, the man's trajectory involves a path where he avoids a sphere in the middle. This suggests an open trajectory. The person will likely approach the sphere, curve around it, and then continue forward. The trajectory can be approximated by a path that begins straight, curves around the obstacle, and then proceeds straight again.

Here's a breakdown of the action:

- Walk forward for some distance.
- Move around the sphere in an arc.
- Continue walking forward after avoiding the sphere.

Given this, the trajectory can be modeled using a combination of linear and circular (arc) movements. I'll design a simple path that transitions smoothly from a straight line to an arc and back to a straight line.

Here's the implementation:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Define parameters for the various segments
    forward_distance1 = 5
    arc_radius = 2
    forward_distance2 = 5
    
    # Up to the first straight line (move forward)
    if t < forward_distance1:
        x = t
        y = 0
    
    # Arc around the sphere
    elif t < forward_distance1 + np.pi * arc_radius:  # arc length = angle in rad * radius
        arc_t = t - forward_distance1
        x = forward_distance1 + arc_radius * np.sin(arc_t / arc_radius)
        y = arc_radius * (1 - np.cos(arc_t / arc_radius))
        
    # After the arc (continue forward)
    else:
        t_end_arc = forward_distance1 + np.pi * arc_radius
        forward_t = t - t_end_arc
        x = forward_distance1 + 2 * arc_radius + forward_t
        y = 2 * arc_radius  # Highest point on the arc is where he comes off to straight line

    return x, y

# The range for t is from 0 to the total length of the path
t_range = (0, forward_distance1 + np.pi * arc_radius + forward_distance2)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Straight Line Segment 1:** The person walks in a straight line initially for a fixed distance (`forward_distance1`).

2. **Arc Segment:** The person moves around a semi-circle arc. The arc is modeled using sine and cosine functions that represent half of the circle due to the obstacle's position (`arc_radius` allows for a semi-circular avoidance).

3. **Straight Line Segment 2:** After avoiding the sphere, the person continues walking straight. The distance after the arc (`forward_distance2`) is included to finalize the trajectory.

This implementation smoothly transitions between line and arc segments, ensuring a continuous, open trajectory where x and y change uniformly over time across the entire path.

        y = arc_radius * (1 - np.cos(arc_t / arc_radius))
        
    # After the arc (continue forward)
    else:

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Straight Approach with Side Step: The man approaches the sphere in a straight line, then takes a quick side step to the right to avoid it, and continues forward.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To create a trajectory based on the description "Straight Approach with Side Step: The man approaches the sphere in a straight line, then takes a quick side step to the right to avoid it, and continues forward," we can interpret this as a straightforward path with a quick lateral movement. This trajectory is an *open trajectory* because it involves a forward movement with a lateral dodge, without returning to the start point.

### Trajectory Breakdown:
1. Start walking straight towards a point.
2. Quickly step to the right to avoid an obstacle.
3. Continue walking straight again.

Now, let's translate this into a mathematical trajectory that smoothly joins each segment:

### Trajectory Analysis:
- **Segment 1:** Walk straight towards the sphere.
- **Segment 2:** Step right to avoid the obstacle.
- **Segment 3:** Continue straight-forward after stepping aside.

For simplicity, we'll assume:
- The walk toward the sphere is along the y-axis.
- The side step is along the x-axis.

### Code Implementation:
We'll use three segments defined by values of `t` to achieve this trajectory. Each segment is smoothly connected with continuous x and y values.

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    # Define the path using conditional statements for different segments
    if t < 3:
        # Segment 1: Walk straight for 3 units, no change in x, just increasing y
        # start_x, start_y = 0, 0 => end_x, end_y = 0, 3
        x = 0
        y = t
    elif t < 4:
        # Segment 2: Step right by 1 unit in 1 time unit
        # start_x, start_y = 0, 3 => end_x, end_y = 1, 3
        x = t - 3
        y = 3
    else:
        # Segment 3: Continue forward from the new x position
        # start_x, start_y = 1, 3 => end_x, end_y = 1, t
        x = 1
        y = t - 1

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
t_range = (0, 8)
```

### Explanation:
- In the first segment, the man moves directly towards the sphere along a straight line without changing x (sideways position).
- In the second segment, the man takes a quick sideways step to the right. This increases x by 1.
- In the third segment, the man continues forward along the new line with the updated x value, moving upward in the y direction again.

This approach ensures continuity and a smooth transition between each segment, maintaining a uniform speed along the trajectory.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Curved Detour: The man approaches the sphere and takes a wide curved detour to the left, smoothly rounding the sphere before returning to his original path.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: Based on the given description, we need to model a trajectory where a person makes a wide, smooth curve around a sphere to the left and then returns to the original path. This implies a curved path, which is essentially part of a circular arc, before getting back to the straight line. Given it's a simple detour, I will provide a direct open trajectory modeling without needing additional detailed breakdown steps.

Let's conceptualize the movement:

1. **Approach the Sphere**: The path starts as a straight line.
2. **Curved Detour**: The path rounds the sphere in a smooth, wide arc.
3. **Return Path**: Straightens out back to the original line.

Since this is part of a larger trajectory description, I won't add numerical breakdown unless needed mathematically for clarity. Instead, I'll directly reflect it in the `shape_curve(t)` function.

Here's the analytical approach implemented into code:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Define parameters for the trajectory
    radius = 5  # arbitrary radius for detouring around the sphere
    
    # Before the curve
    x1 = t
    y1 = 0
    
    # During the curve
    angle = np.pi * t  # smooth curvature
    x2 = radius * (1 - np.cos(angle))
    y2 = radius * np.sin(angle)
    
    # After the curve: Return to y = 0 going straight
    x3 = 2 * radius + t
    y3 = 0
    
    # Determine position based on t
    if t < 1:
        # Initially moving straight before curve
        x, y = x1, y1
    elif 1 <= t < 2:
        # In the curved detour section
        x, y = x2, y2
    else:
        # After rounding the sphere returning to original path
        x, y = x3, y3
    
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 3)  # From start (approach) through curve and until return
```

### Explanation:
- The person starts walking straight along the x-axis (initial segment `x1, y1`).
- It transitions into a curve (`x2, y2`) detouring to the left around a circular path.
- The formula for the curved path is based on portions of a unit circle (using cosine and sine), adjusted to ensure a smooth transition.
- It completes the curve, returning to the linear trajectory (`x3, y3`), parallel to the starting path, assuming a wide circle return path.
- The parameter `t` is organized to separate each movement phase but maintains continuity across the trajectory.

This function can be plugged directly into any environment to visualize the trajectory described.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Zig-Zag Path: The man walks in a zig-zag pattern, adjusting his direction sharply as he nears the sphere to avoid it, then resumes a straight path after passing.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: Based on the description of the "Zig-Zag Path", it seems you're looking for an open trajectory that involves sharp turns often associated with a zig-zag pattern. This suggests a path where the trajectory has abrupt changes in direction.

### Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:
- The trajectory is **open** because it outlines a path with a specific start and end point as opposed to enclosing an area or returning to its starting point.

### Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:
1. **Start**: Begin walking in a straight line.
2. **Turn**: Upon approaching the sphere, make a sharp turn at roughly 45 degrees.
3. **Alternate**: Continue alternating directions in zig-zag fashion until past the sphere.
4. **Straighten**: After the sphere, resume a straight path.

### Trajectory Analysis:
- The trajectory comprises a series of straight segments with sharp turns at angles characteristic of a zig-zag.
- `t` will correspond to time, and we'll ensure a consistent speed along the path.
- Ensure smooth transitions; x and y coordinates should change at a uniform rate over each segment of `t`.

### Mathematical Functions:
Below is the code representation of the described zig-zag trajectory.

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    if t < 0:  # Initial straight path
        x = t
        y = 0
    elif t < 1:  # First zag
        x = t
        y = t
    elif t < 2:  # First zig
        x = 1 - (t - 1)
        y = t
    elif t < 3:  # Second zag
        x = -(t - 2)
        y = 3 - (t - 2)
    elif t < 4:  # Second zig (avoiding sphere vicinity)
        x = -(2 - (t - 3))
        y = 3 - t
    else:  # Straight path after avoiding
        x = -(t - 4)
        y = -1

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (-2, 6)
```

### Explanation:
- From `t = -2` to `t = 0`, the path begins with a straight trajectory.
- Between increments of `t`, the path alternates in direction (zig-zag) to emulate sharp turns commonly seen in zig-zag paths.
- The overall path is open and smooth continuation of coordinates ensures alignment without abrupt jumps.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Sudden Stop and Sidestep: The man runs directly toward the sphere, stops abruptly upon nearing it, shifts to the right with a small sidestep, and then continues.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To represent the trajectory described, let's break down the movement actions:

1. **Run Directly Toward the Sphere:** This represents moving in a straight line.
2. **Stop Abruptly Upon Nearing It:** This is where the trajectory will temporarily halt.
3. **Shift to the Right with a Small Sidestep:** This involves a small lateral movement.
4. **Continue Forward Again:** The trajectory resumes forward motion after the sidestep.

Based on the description, this is an open trajectory.

Now, let’s construct the mathematical representation for this trajectory:

### Trajectory Breakdown

1. **Run Forward:**
   - Start at (0, 0)
   - Move forward for, say, `d1` meters. This is a linear segment.

2. **Stop for a Moment:** (This is not visually represented in motion; just a note to indicate a change.)

3. **Sidestep to the Right:**
   - Slightly increase `x` (horizontal axis), keeping `y` constant.

4. **Resume Forward:**
   - Continue moving forward after sidestep.

Let's define `shape_curve(t)`:

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    if 0 <= t < 1:
        # First segment: Running forward
        # Start: (0, 0), End: (0, d1)
        x = 0
        y = 10 * t  # Assume 'd1' is 10 units for simplicity

    elif 1 <= t < 2:
        # Second segment: Sidestep to the right
        # Starting where first segment ended: (0, 10)
        # Ending: (1, 10) with a small sidestep to the right
        # Continuity: start_x = 0, start_y = 10, end_x = 1, end_y = 10
        x = 1 * (t - 1)  # Sidestep 1 unit to the right
        y = 10

    elif 2 <= t <= 3:
        # Third segment: Continue forward
        # Start: (1, 10), End: (1, d1 + d2)
        # Continuity: start_x = 1, start_y = 10, end_x = 1, end_y = 20
        x = 1
        y = 10 + 10 * (t - 2)  # Move another 10 units forward

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 3)
```

### Explanation:

- **Segment 1 (0 <= t < 1):** Represents running directly forward.
- **Segment 2 (1 <= t < 2):** Illustrates a sidestep to the right.
- **Segment 3 (2 <= t <= 3):** Shows continued forward motion post-sidestep.

The trajectory is open, showing a continuous, smooth path from start to the end with increments for `t` ensuring no abrupt jumps. Adjust the parameters `d1` and segment lengths as per precise requirements or scaling.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Diagonal Approach with Quick Turn: The man approaches the sphere diagonally, quickly turning left when he is close, and then resuming his original direction after passing the sphere.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To create a trajectory that represents the described path, we start by breaking down the movement into key segments:

1. **Diagonal Approach**: The man approaches the sphere diagonally, which means we start with a diagonal line. Assume this is a path moving towards the bottom-right.
2. **Quick Turn Left**: When he gets close to the sphere, he makes a quick left turn. Assuming the original diagonal was directed towards the 4-5 o'clock direction, the left turn would face him towards the 1-2 o'clock direction.
3. **Resume Original Direction**: After the turn and passing the sphere, he resumes his initial diagonal direction.

With this understanding, let's define a smooth trajectory function in Python:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Define the trajectory using parametric equations
    if t < 1:  # Diagonal approach
        start_x, start_y = 0, 0
        end_x, end_y = 1, 1
        x = start_x + (end_x - start_x) * t
        y = start_y + (end_y - start_y) * t
    elif t < 1.5:  # Quick left turn
        start_x, start_y = 1, 1
        end_x, end_y = 0.5, 1.5
        # Smoothing the turn
        turn_t = (t - 1) * 2  # Scale t to fit in [0, 1] for this segment
        x = start_x + (end_x - start_x) * turn_t
        y = start_y + (end_y - start_y) * turn_t
    else:  # Resume original direction
        start_x, start_y = 0.5, 1.5
        end_x, end_y = 1.5, 2.5
        resume_t = (t - 1.5) * 2  # Scale t to fit in [0, 1] for this segment
        x = start_x + (end_x - start_x) * resume_t

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (important for specifying how long each segment is traveled)
t_range = (0, 2)
```

### Explanation:
1. **t < 1**: This segment covers the diagonal approach. \( t = 0 \) starts from (0, 0) and goes to (1, 1) as \( t \) approaches 1.

2. **1 ≤ t < 1.5**: During this segment, the quick left turn is made, moving from (1, 1) to (0.5, 1.5).

3. **t ≥ 1.5**: The man resumes his original direction after the turn, moving from (0.5, 1.5) to (1.5, 2.5).

The function ensures smooth transitions between each part of the trajectory and maintains uniform movement along the path defined by each segment.

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open. So, avoid using a closed trajectory for an open path like S, a common error is to make it like shape 8.

If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front

7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.
Emphasize once again: To ensure a smooth transition, you need to adjust the formulas for each segment so that they start from the endpoint coordinates of the previous segment, rather than independently redefining ( x ) and ( y ). If there are multiple segments, the starting and ending coordinates for each segment should be clearly marked in the comments as **start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y**.

"I want to draw a Description = 'S-Shape Curve: The man creates an S-shaped curve in his path, first curving to the left as he nears the sphere, then curving back to the right once he has passed.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To draw an "S-shape" curve, we need an open trajectory since the path starts at one point and ends at another without returning to the start, as in a regular 'S' pattern. This trajectory can be represented using a parametric function that smoothly traces an 'S' shape in a 2D plane.

Here's how you can implement the trajectory for the 'S-shape' path:

**Code:**

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Parametric equation for an 'S' shape
    x = t  # Linear progression along the x-axis
    y = np.sin(t)  # S shape using sine wave for vertical progression

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
# The range for t is chosen such that the 'S' shape is clearly visible.
t_range = (-np.pi, np.pi)
```

### Explanation:

- **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision**: The trajectory is open. It starts on one side of the curve and ends on the other.
  
- **Mathematical Functions**:
  - The equation uses `x = t`, meaning the x-coordinate progresses linearly with time `t`.
  - The y-coordinate is dictated by `y = np.sin(t)`, which gives us a sine wave shape, naturally forming an 'S' pattern when plotted with the given range of `t`.
  
- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - This is a simple representation utilizing trigonometric functions to provide smooth transitions and a continuous curve, ensuring the shape is an 'S'.
  - Range of `t` (-π, π) provides a complete 'S' curve that curves left first and then back right, achieving the needed path without abrupt changes.

This approach efficiently captures the smooth and continuous nature of the 'S' path described in the input. Adjust `t_range` if a larger or more contracted 'S' shape is desired.

**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open. So, avoid using a closed trajectory for an open path like S, a common error is to make it like shape 8.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.
Emphasize once again: To ensure a smooth transition, you need to adjust the formulas for each segment so that they start from the endpoint coordinates of the previous segment, rather than independently redefining ( x ) and ( y ). If there are multiple segments, the starting and ending coordinates for each segment should be clearly marked in the comments as **start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y**.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Semi-Circle Loop: The man moves in a semi-circle around the sphere, starting on the right side and curving left until he returns to his original direction.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To create a trajectory based on the given description of a "Semi-Circle Loop," we'll consider it an open trajectory because it does not complete a full circle back to the starting point. Instead, it describes a half-turn from one direction back towards the original direction without forming a closed loop.

### Trajectory Analysis:

1. **Path Description:**
   - The person starts on the right side of a sphere (imagine starting at 3 o'clock).
   - They move in a semi-circle from right to left, curving back to the original direction (ending at 9 o'clock).

2. **Closed or Open Trajectory:** 
   - **Open Trajectory:** The path described does not close back to the starting point, hence it's open.

3. **Trajectory Breakdown (if necessary):**
   - As the shape primarily involves a simple semi-circular arc, we can avoid detailed breakdowns and directly use the appropriate parametric equations.

4. **Mathematical Representation:**
   - We'll parameterize the semi-circle using cosine and sine functions, which naturally describe circular paths.

Here is the function:

```python
import math

def shape_curve(t):
    # Assume the radius of the semi-circle is 1, starting at (1, 0) and ending at (-1, 0)
    # Start coordinates: (1.0, 0.0)
    # End coordinates: (-1.0, 0.0)
    
    # Calculate x and y based on the parametric equations for a semi-circle
    x = math.cos(t)
    y = math.sin(t)
    
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t for a semi-circle (0 to pi)
t_range = (0, math.pi)
```

### Explanation:
- **t_range:** We define the range of `t` from `0` to `math.pi` (π) since a full circle spans from `0` to `2π`, a semi-circle is half of that.
- The starting point is `(1, 0)`, moving left in a semi-circle to `(-1, 0)` as `t` goes from `0` to `π`, representing a smooth, continuous motion.
- **Uniform Movement:** The x and y coordinates are uniformly computed as the functions of `t`, ensuring continuous movement over the trajectory.
extracted_code: import math

def shape_curve(t):
    # Assume the radius of the semi-circle is 1, starting at (1, 0) and ending at (-1, 0)
    # Start coordinates: (1.0, 0.0)
    # End coordinates: (-1.0, 0.0)
    
    # Calculate x and y based on the parametric equations for a semi-circle
    x = math.cos(t)
    y = math.sin(t)

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Slow Walk with Precise Steps Around: The man slows down his pace as he nears the sphere, carefully steps to the right and left around it in small adjustments, and then resumes his normal walking pace.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: Based on the description provided, it seems like the trajectory represents a closed loop around a spherical object. The person carefully steps around the sphere, moving slightly to the right and left, and then resumes a normal walking pace. This suggests a circular or elliptical path around the sphere. Here’s how we can analyze and code this trajectory:

### Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:
- **Closed Trajectory**: Since the man is making adjustments around a sphere and resumes walking afterward, this implies the trajectory encompasses a loop around the sphere, meaning it's closed.

### Trajectory Analysis:
- The man approaches the sphere, slows down, makes a circular path around it with slight lateral movements, and then potentially moves away or continues, implying returning to the starting point or passing through it, completing a loop.

### Mathematical Representation:
Given the simplicity and clarity of the path, we can represent the overall trajectory as a smooth elliptical path to mimic "stepping to the right and left around" in a continuous looping manner. Here’s the code to generate this:

```python
import math

def shape_curve(t):
    # Simple elliptical path
    a = 5  # semi-major axis (horizontal reach)
    b = 3  # semi-minor axis (vertical reach)
    x_center, y_center = (0, 0)  # Center of the sphere

    # Parametric equations for an ellipse
    # x and y will vary uniformly as t varies, representing consistent pacing
    x = x_center + (a + 0.2 * math.sin(8 * math.pi * t)) * math.cos(2 * math.pi * t)
    y = y_center + (b + 0.2 * math.sin(8 * math.pi * t)) * math.sin(2 * math.pi * t)

    return x, y

# The range of t is from 0 to 1 to complete a full loop around the sphere
t_range = (0, 1)
```

### Explanation:
- **x** and **y**: Represent the horizontal and vertical positions, respectively.
- **a** and **b**: Semi-major and semi-minor axes for the elliptical path.
- **0.2 * math.sin(8 * math.pi * t)**: Adds slight lateral undulations (waviness) to simulate careful adjustment and stepping around the sphere.
- **t_range = (0, 1)**: Defines the range for `t` completing a full loop around the sphere.

This function creates a continuous, smooth elliptical trajectory approximating the described path around the sphere with subtle right and left adjustments.

    # Simple elliptical path

Model: Based on the given instruction, I will create a function `shape_curve(t)` without needing a breakdown since no specific trajectory description was provided. Instead, I'll demonstrate how to handle a simple open trajectory as an example: drawing the trajectory of a straight path.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Descent ：a man is walking/runing, he tried to avoid one sphere in the middle. his trajectory is a Descent Line'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: Based on the description provided, the trajectory of the man's path can be visualized as a simple open descent line, which involves avoiding a sphere along the way. Given it's a descent line, the trajectory is likely a simple linear path with a slight detour.

### Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:
- **Open Trajectory**: The description suggests the trajectory is an open path, as it is a descent line and there's no mention of returning to a starting point.

### Trajectory Analysis:
Since the trajectory involves a descent and avoiding a sphere, we can interpret this as a general downward path with a slight horizontal deviation. We can imagine the path as a straight diagonal line that has a slight curve to avoid the sphere temporarily.

### Mathematical Function:
To model this trajectory as described, let's create a linear descent with a small deviation to represent avoiding the sphere. We assume a simple linear path for the descent with a curvature to avoid an obstacle.

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Trajectory Constants
    k = 0.5        # Slope of descent
    deviation_magnitude = 0.1  # Magnitude of deviation to avoid the sphere

    # Linear descent with a deviation for avoiding a sphere
    x = t
    y = -k * t + deviation_magnitude * np.sin(np.pi * t / 2)  # Curve to avoid sphere temporarily

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
t_range = (0, 10)
```

In this function, `x` represents the forward movement, and `y` the descent as the man walks. The sine function adds a small, smooth deviation to represent the avoidance of the sphere, resulting in a smooth descent line with a slight lateral movement. The range of `t` is set from 0 to 10 to represent the trajectory's duration.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Cycloid  ：a man is walking/runing, he tried to avoid one sphere in the middle. his trajectory is a Cycloid Line'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To create a trajectory for a cycloid, which is the path traced by a point on the rim of a circular wheel as the wheel rolls along a straight line, we need to consider the mathematical representation for such a curve. A cycloid curve is usually defined parametrically as:

- \( x(t) = r(t - \sin(t)) \)
- \( y(t) = r(1 - \cos(t)) \)

Where:
- \( r \) is the radius of the circle (wheel)
- \( t \) is the parameter (often related to time)

Given the description, the trajectory should be an open cycloid because it represents the path of a person walking or running, avoiding an object (the sphere), thus moving in a single direction rather than returning to a starting point.

Now, let's provide the code for the cycloid trajectory:

```python
import math

```

**Explanation:**
- The trajectory function `shape_curve(t)` generates the x and y coordinates for the cycloid at each time \( t \).
- The range of \( t \) is from 0 to \( 2\pi \), corresponding to one full rotation of the wheel, which gives a complete cycle of the cycloid.
- This open trajectory is appropriate as it models the path discussed in the problem statement where the man is moving in a single direction.

**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open. So, avoid using a closed trajectory for an open path like S, a common error is to make it like shape 8.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.
Emphasize once again: To ensure a smooth transition, you need to adjust the formulas for each segment so that they start from the endpoint coordinates of the previous segment, rather than independently redefining ( x ) and ( y ). If there are multiple segments, the starting and ending coordinates for each segment should be clearly marked in the comments as **start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y**.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'semicircle: a man is walking/runing, he tried to avoid one sphere in the middle.In detail, he first walk in a straight line, he then walk in a semicircle to avoid the sphere, and then walk in a straight line again.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: Based on the description provided, we need to draw an open trajectory representing a path where a person walks in a straight line, then takes a semicircular detour, and finally resumes walking in a straight line. The semicircle indicates a deviation to avoid an obstacle. Here's how we can break down the movement:

1. **Starting Straight Line:** Walk forward in a straight line.
2. **Semicircle Detour:** Veer into a semicircle, which will have smooth transitions between entering and exiting.
3. **Ending Straight Line:** Resume walking in a straight line after the semicircle.

For simplicity, let's assume the semicircle is a half circle centered along the initial straight path. We'll start the trajectory at the origin (0, 0), proceed in a positive x direction for the straight line. 

**Trajectory Breakdown:**

1. **Straight Line, Part 1:**
   - Start at (0, 0), walk forward to (5, 0).

2. **Semicircle:**
   - Curve starts at x=5 and ends at x=15, forming the top half of a circle. 
   - The semicircle is centered at (10, 5), with a radius of 5.

3. **Straight Line, Part 2:**
   - Resume from (15, 0) to (20, 0).

With these observations, we can form the trajectory using piecewise functions for each segment. Here's the code setup:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    if 0 <= t < 1:
        # Straight line part 1
        start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y = 0, 0, 5, 0
        x = start_x + (end_x - start_x) * t  # Linear interpolation for x
        y = start_y + (end_y - start_y) * t  # Linear interpolation for y
    elif 1 <= t < 2:
        # Semicircle
        start_angle, end_angle = 0, np.pi  # angle in radians for half-circle
        radius = 5
        center_x, center_y = 10, 5
        angle = start_angle + (end_angle - start_angle) * (t - 1)
        x = center_x + radius * np.cos(angle)
        y = center_y + radius * np.sin(angle)
    elif 2 <= t <= 3:
        # Straight line part 2
        start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y = 15, 0, 20, 0
        x = start_x + (end_x - start_x) * (t - 2)  # Linear interpolation for x
        y = start_y + (end_y - start_y) * (t - 2)  # Linear interpolation for y

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 3)
```

**Explanation:**

- The code represents the path in three segments using piecewise functions.
- Each segment ensures continuity by starting where the last one left off.
- The variable `t` covers the entire trajectory from start to end, with each segment implementing its specified range smoothly.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Descent_line_avoid: a man is walking/runing, he tried to avoid one sphere in the middle.In detail, he first walk in a straight line, he then walk in a Descent Line to avoid the sphere, and then walk in a straight line again.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: ### Trajectory Analysis

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:**
   - The trajectory is open. The description involves starting at one point and ending at another without returning to the start point.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
   - Start walking straight.
   - When nearing the sphere, perform a descent line (a gentle curve or angled path) to avoid the sphere.
   - Continue walking straight after clearing the sphere.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:**
   - The path involves three segments:
     1. A straight line to the approach of the sphere.
     2. A descent line around the sphere, which can be represented as a smooth curve.
     3. Another straight line continuing from the descent line.

### Mathematical Representation

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Parameters
    straight_line_length_1 = 3
    avoid_length = 2
    straight_line_length_2 = 3
    
    # Segment 1: Walk straight (0 <= t < 1)
    if 0 <= t < 1:
        x = t * straight_line_length_1
        y = 0
    
    # Segment 2: Descend Line to avoid the sphere (1 <= t < 2) (using a curve)
    elif 1 <= t < 2:
        t_segment = t - 1  # Normalizing t for this segment
        x = straight_line_length_1 + t_segment * (avoid_length * np.cos(np.pi / 3))
        y = 0.5 * avoid_length * np.sin(np.pi / 3) * np.sin(np.pi * t_segment)
    
    # Segment 3: Walk straight again (2 <= t <= 3)
    elif 2 <= t <= 3:
        t_segment = t - 2  # Normalizing t for this segment
        x = straight_line_length_1 + avoid_length * np.cos(np.pi / 3) + t_segment * straight_line_length_2
        y = 0
    
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 3)
```

### Key Points

- **Continuity & Smooth Transition:** Each segment seamlessly connects with the next. 
- **Uniform Speed:** All segments ensure uniform motion speed, reflected by even t parameters.
  
This function smoothly transitions between straight paths and a descent line to simulate avoiding a sphere while maintaining consistent motion.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Cycloid_line_avoid: a man is walking/runing, he tried to avoid one sphere in the middle.In detail, he first walk in a straight line, he then walk in a Cycloid Line to avoid the sphere, and then walk in a straight line again.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To draw the trajectory of the given description involving a man walking/running and avoiding a sphere using a cycloidal path, we'll break down the movement into clear sections, focusing on creating a smooth and continuous path.

### Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:
The trajectory described is **open** because it starts and ends at different points without looping back to the starting point.

### Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:
1. **Walk straight forward** until approaching the sphere.
2. **Transition into a cycloidal path** to maneuver around the sphere, creating a distinctive cycloid curve.
3. **Return to walking straight** after passing the sphere.

### Trajectory Analysis:
Let's consider a starting point at `(0, 0)`. The person first walks straight ahead. Then, as they approach an obstacle (the sphere), they transition into a cycloidal motion. Once they have circumvented the obstacle, they continue again in a straight line.

### Mathematical Representation:
- **Segment 1:** Linear path from start to begin cycloid.
- **Segment 2:** Cycloidal motion to circumvent the sphere.
- **Segment 3:** Linear path from the end of the cycloid to a stopping point.

### Implementing the Code:
```python
import numpy as np

    # Parameters for controlling the trajectory
    sphere_center = (5, 0)  # Hypothetical location of the sphere
    sphere_radius = 2       # Radius of sphere

        y = 0
        # Transition point to cycloid trajectory

```

### Explanation:
- The trajectory transitions from a linear path to a cycloidal path and back to a linear path.
- Adjustments are made to ensure smooth transitions between segments.
- The trajectory approximates avoiding a sphere (`sphere_center`) by creating a cycloid path around it.
- The parameter `t` represents a continuous time variable used to generate the path.

This code provides a smooth trajectory for a man moving in a described open path, distinguishing between the stages of walking straight and performing a cycloidal motion around the sphere.

Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.
Emphasize once again: To ensure a smooth transition, you need to adjust the formulas for each segment so that they start from the endpoint coordinates of the previous segment, rather than independently redefining ( x ) and ( y ). If there are multiple segments, the starting and ending coordinates for each segment should be clearly marked in the comments as **start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y**.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Descent ：a man is walking/runing, he tried to avoid one sphere in the middle. his trajectory is a half-Descent Line.# Adjust theta range to show only one arch (half of a full cycle) theta_half = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 250) x_half = radius * (theta_half - np.sin(theta_half)) y_half = radius * (1 - np.cos(theta_half))'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: Based on the description provided, the trajectory seems to be an open path, specifically a half-cycloid arc. This is deduced from the "half-Descent Line" and further confirmed by the detailed half-cycloid formula provided in the description for \(x\) and \(y\).

### Trajectory Analysis
1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision**: This is an **open** trajectory since it represents a single arc of a cycloid.
2. **Extract the Trajectory**: Not required in this case since a specific formula is given.
3. **Trajectory Analysis**: The given formulas represent the parametric equations of a half-cycloid, which describe the path of a point on a wheel as it rolls along a straight line.

Here's how you can implement the trajectory in the given format:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Radius of the circle
    radius = 1  # You can adjust the radius as needed

    # Parametric equations for a half-cycloid
    x = radius * (t - np.sin(t))
    y = radius * (1 - np.cos(t))
    
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
# The half-cycloid for a single arch goes from 0 to 2π
t_range = (0, 2 * np.pi)
```

### Additional Notes
- **Consistency and Smoothness**: The `shape_curve` function maintains smooth transitions, and both x and y coordinates consistently change as t increases.
- **t Range**: The specified range of t is from 0 to \(2\pi\), which ensures that the trajectory represents exactly one arch of a cycloid.

**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open. So, avoid using a closed trajectory for an open path like S, a common error is to make it like shape 8.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:

9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'walk_Descent_walk ：a man is walking/runing, he tried to avoid one sphere using half-Descent Line trajectory in the middle.

Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To construct the described trajectory, we need to carefully break down the movement: 

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:**
   - The trajectory is open because it's a linear path with a semi-circular diversion, not forming a closed loop.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
   - Walk straight for 10 meters.
   - Turn using a half-Descent Line trajectory for 10 meters.
   - Walk straight for another 10 meters.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:**
   - Start by walking straight, then divert using a half-Descent Line curve, and continue straight again.
   - Ensure smooth transitions and consistent speed over time.

4. **Mathematical Functions:**
   - The linear segments can be implemented using linear equations.
   - The half-Descent Line trajectory (an approximation similar to cycloid arc) can be implemented using parametric equations.

Here's how you can formulate the trajectory:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Parameters for each segment
    start_straight_length = 10
    half_descent_length = 10
    end_straight_length = 10

    # Calculate segment boundaries in 't'
    segment_1_end = start_straight_length
    segment_2_end = start_straight_length + half_descent_length
    segment_3_end = start_straight_length + half_descent_length + end_straight_length

    if t <= segment_1_end:
        # Segment 1: Walk straight (0 to 10 meters)
        x = t
        y = 0
    elif t <= segment_2_end:
        # Segment 2: Half-Descent Line trajectory (10 to 20 meters)
        # Normalize t for this segment
        t_norm = t - segment_1_end
        # Using a parametric representation of half a cycloid-like path
        # `t_norm` goes from 0 to `half_descent_length`
        adjusted_t = (t_norm / half_descent_length) * np.pi
        x = segment_1_end + (adjusted_t - np.sin(adjusted_t))
        y = 1 - np.cos(adjusted_t)
    else:
        # Segment 3: Walk straight again (20 to 30 meters)
        t_norm = t - segment_2_end
        x = segment_2_end + t_norm
        y = 0

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t, assuming a smooth transition for each segment
t_range = (0, 30)
```

The trajectory is crafted to maintain smooth transitions between the segments. 

- The first segment is linear, with a movement straight along the x-axis.
- The second segment introduces a half-Descent Line-like curve, designed to achieve the desired path.
- The third segment continues straight from the point reached after the curve.

This allows you to visualize a person following the described path smoothly.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Descent ：a man is walking/runing, he tried to avoid one sphere in the middle. his trajectory is a half-Descent Line.# Adjust theta range to show only one arch (half of a full cycle)'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To create the trajectory described as "a half-Descent Line" where a man avoids a sphere, it indicates smooth movement with slight curvature to avoid the obstacle. This suggests an open trajectory rather than a closed loop.

Here's how we can break down and analyze this movement:

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** This trajectory is open since it's described as a descent with one specific curve to avoid an obstacle (the sphere) without linking back to the start.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:** In this description, the trajectory suggests a smooth arching path, likely similar to part of a sinusoidal wave or a parabolic curve, avoiding a specific area.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Assume the trajectory begins straight and then adjusts to curve slightly, diverting around the sphere before continuing again straight.

Let's translate this into a mathematical function. We can use part of a sine curve to visualize this trajectory for smoothness:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Simulating half a sine wave for avoiding the sphere
    # start_x, start_y = t, 0  where t ranges from 0 to π (in radians) for a clear half sine wave.
    # end_x, end_y = π, 0
    x = t
    y = np.sin(t)  # This creates a half-arch or descent motion

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, np.pi)
```

### Explanation:
- **Trajectory Function:** `x = t`, `y = np.sin(t)`: This simulates a half sine wave where `y` is zero at both start and end, creating a natural arch that quickly rises and falls back, simulating the avoidance motion.
  
- **Range of `t`:** From `0` to `π`, which gives a smooth ascent and descent forming the half arch while maintaining continuity and uniform speed over time.

This function captures the essence of avoiding an object using a single curving motion, effectively simulating a man's path as he runs or walks around an obstacle.
extracted_code: import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Simulating half a sine wave for avoiding the sphere

Model: Based on the description provided, the trajectory involves a person walking in a straight line, taking a semicircular path to avoid an obstacle, and then continuing straight. This forms an open trajectory. Let's break it down:

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory is open because it involves distinct start and end points with no return to the starting point.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown (Simplified):**
   
   - Walk straight for 10 meters.
   - Turn using a half-Descent line (semicircular in concept) for 10 meters.
   - Walk straight again for 10 meters.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:**
   - The trajectory consists of a straight segment, a semicircular curve, and another straight segment.
   - Ensure smooth transitions between these segments.

The semicircular path can be represented using a parametric equation for a circle segment (using cosine and sine functions), adjusted to only represent half of the circle.

Let's write the code:

```python
import math

def shape_curve(t):
    # Define parameters for the trajectory
    straight_length = 10
    curve_radius = 5  # Half of the semicircle's diameter
    theta_start = 0
    theta_end = math.pi
    
    # Initialize x, y
    x, y = 0, 0
    
    # Determine the section of the trajectory based on t
    if 0 <= t < straight_length:
        # First straight segment
        x = t
        y = 0
    elif straight_length <= t < straight_length + curve_radius * math.pi:
        # Semicircular section (half Descent line)
        theta = (t - straight_length) / curve_radius
        x = straight_length + curve_radius * math.cos(theta)
        y = curve_radius * math.sin(theta)
    elif straight_length + curve_radius * math.pi <= t <= 2 * straight_length + curve_radius * math.pi:

Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.
Emphasize once again: To ensure a smooth transition, you need to adjust the formulas for each segment so that they start from the endpoint coordinates of the previous segment, rather than independently redefining ( x ) and ( y ). If there are multiple segments, the starting and ending coordinates for each segment should be clearly marked in the comments as **start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y**.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'semi_cirlcle_avoid_walk ：a man is walking/runing, he tried to avoid one sphere using semi_cirlcle trajectory in the middle. It means that he walks straight 10 m first, then turn using a  semi_cirlcle trajectory(10 m ), than walk straight (10 m )again.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To create this trajectory, we need a combination of linear and circular movements. The trajectory described consists of three segments:

1. Walk straight for 10 meters.
2. Turn using a semicircular trajectory (with a diameter of 10 meters).
3. Walk straight again for another 10 meters.

Let's break down the trajectory step-by-step:

### Description Breakdown:
- **Segment 1**: Walk straight for 10 meters.
- **Segment 2**: Perform a semicircle with a radius of 5 meters.
- **Segment 3**: Walk straight for another 10 meters.

### Trajectory Analysis:
- **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision**: This is an open trajectory because the starting and ending points are not the same.
- **Ensure continuity**: We ensure each segment starts where the previous one ended.

### Mathematical Representation:
We will represent each part in terms of a parameter `t` for the path:

- **Segment 1**: Linear trajectory from (0,0) to (10,0)
- **Segment 2**: Semicircle trajectory from (10,0) to (10,10)
- **Segment 3**: Linear trajectory from (10,10) to (20,10)

Here's how the code can be structured:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Segment 1: Start from (0,0) to (10,0)
    if 0 <= t < 10:
        start_x, start_y = 0, 0
        end_x, end_y = 10, 0
        x = start_x + (end_x - start_x) * (t - 0) / 10
        y = start_y + (end_y - start_y) * (t - 0) / 10

    # Segment 2: Semicircle, counterclockwise from (10,0) to (10,10)
    elif 10 <= t < 20:
        theta = (t - 10) * np.pi / 10  # 0 to pi
        radius = 5
        center_x, center_y = 10, 5
        x = center_x - radius * np.cos(theta)
        y = center_y + radius * np.sin(theta)

    # Segment 3: Linear trajectory from (10,10) to (20,10)
    elif 20 <= t <= 30:
        start_x, start_y = 10, 10
        end_x, end_y = 20, 10
        x = start_x + (end_x - start_x) * (t - 20) / 10
        y = start_y + (end_y - start_y) * (t - 20) / 10

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
t_range = (0, 30)
```

### Explanation:
- **Segment 1**: Moves in a straight line from (0,0) to (10,0).
- **Segment 2**: Creates a semicircle with its center offset by 5 meters above the path, using trigonometric functions to describe the arc.
- **Segment 3**: Continues in a straight line from (10,10) to (20,10).

This code defines a `shape_curve(t)` function that gives the (x, y) positions for a person following the described trajectory. Adjust the `t` values according to your specific needs or tests.

**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open. So, avoid using a closed trajectory for an open path like S, a common error is to make it like shape 8.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'A man is walking in a straight line.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: Based on the given description, the trajectory of "a man walking in a straight line" is an open trajectory. Since the path is simple, it does not require a complex breakdown or trajectory analysis.

Here’s how you can represent this trajectory using a linear equation, maintaining consistency in movement speed:

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    # A straight line trajectory from (0, 0) to (10, 0)
    # Here, we assume that the person walks along the x-axis.
    # start_x = 0, start_y = 0, end_x = 10, end_y = 0

    x = t  # x changes from 0 to 10
    y = 0  # y remains constant as it's a straight line along the x-axis

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 10)
```

In this setup, the person starts at the origin `(0, 0)` and walks straight along the x-axis up to `(10, 0)`, assuming a uniform speed across the given range of `t`. Adjust the range of `t` if a different segment length is needed.
extracted_code: def shape_curve(t):
    # A straight line trajectory from (0, 0) to (10, 0)
    # Here, we assume that the person walks along the x-axis.
    # start_x = 0, start_y = 0, end_x = 10, end_y = 0

    x = t  # x changes from 0 to 10
    y = 0  # y remains constant as it's a straight line along the x-axis

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
