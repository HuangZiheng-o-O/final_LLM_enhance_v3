**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.
再次强调：为了确保平滑过渡，您需要调整每一段段的公式，使其从上一段的终点坐标开始，而不是独立地重新定义 x 和 y。如果有不同的t段落，每一段的开始坐标和结束坐标应该在注释中标注出来！start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'CapitalW: using a trajectory resembling the capital letter 'W'.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: Based on your request to represent the trajectory as a capital letter 'W', we'll derive the corresponding mathematical function. We assume a uniform speed for movement, ensuring a smooth transition and continuity.

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** 
   - The trajectory is open because the letter 'W' does not loop back to its starting point.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
   - Starting from the bottom left of 'W'.
   - Move diagonally up and to the right.
   - Move diagonally down and to the right.
   - Move diagonally up and to the right again.
   - Move diagonally down and to the right.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:**
   - We will divide the trajectory into four segments, ensuring that each starts from where the previous ended.
   - Each segment will be represented by a linear path between two points.

Here's the final code:

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    if 0 <= t < 1:
        # Segment 1: from (0, 0) to (1, 1)
        x = t
        y = t
    elif 1 <= t < 2:
        # Segment 2: from (1, 1) to (2, 0)
        x = 1 + (t - 1)
        y = 1 - (t - 1)
    elif 2 <= t < 3:
        # Segment 3: from (2, 0) to (3, 1)
        x = 2 + (t - 2)
        y = t - 2
    elif 3 <= t <= 4:
        # Segment 4: from (3, 1) to (4, 0)
        x = 3 + (t - 3)
        y = 1 - (t - 3)
    else:
        x = None
        y = None

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 4)
```

**Explanation:**

- **Segment 1** starts at (0, 0) and ends at (1, 1), representing the bottom-left to top-middle left diagonal of the 'W'.
- **Segment 2** starts at (1, 1) and ends at (2, 0), representing the top-middle left to bottom-middle middle diagonal.
- **Segment 3** starts at (2, 0) and ends at (3, 1), representing the bottom-middle middle to top-middle right.
- **Segment 4** starts at (3, 1) and ends at (4, 0), representing the top-middle right to bottom-right diagonal.

The function `shape_curve(t)` ensures smooth transitions with t ranging from 0 to 4, achieving the capital letter 'W' trajectory.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'CapitalW: using a trajectory resembling the capital letter 'W'.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: Based on the description provided, we need to draw a trajectory resembling the capital letter 'W'. Since it involves multiple segments forming the shape of a 'W', it's an open trajectory.

### Trajectory Analysis and Breakdown:

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Open Trajectory

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
   - Start at the bottom-left corner of 'W'.
   - Move upwards to the peak.
   - Move downwards to the midpoint of the 'W' at the bottom.
   - Move upwards to the second peak.
   - Move downwards to the bottom-right corner of 'W'.
   
3. **Mathematical Functions:** 
   Let's break down the 'W' into four linear segments. We'll use `t` to parameterize the position along each segment.

- Segment 1: From (0, 0) to (0.25, 1)
- Segment 2: From (0.25, 1) to (0.5, 0)
- Segment 3: From (0.5, 0) to (0.75, 1)
- Segment 4: From (0.75, 1) to (1, 0)

We'll use the `t` parameter to transition smoothly between these segments.

### Implementation:

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    if 0 <= t < 0.25:
        # Segment 1: (0, 0) to (0.25, 1)
        start_x, start_y = 0, 0
        end_x, end_y = 0.25, 1
        local_t = (t - 0) / 0.25
        x = start_x + local_t * (end_x - start_x)
        y = start_y + local_t * (end_y - start_y)
    elif 0.25 <= t < 0.5:
        # Segment 2: (0.25, 1) to (0.5, 0)
        start_x, start_y = 0.25, 1
        end_x, end_y = 0.5, 0
        local_t = (t - 0.25) / 0.25
        x = start_x + local_t * (end_x - start_x)
        y = start_y + local_t * (end_y - start_y)
    elif 0.5 <= t < 0.75:
        # Segment 3: (0.5, 0) to (0.75, 1)
        start_x, start_y = 0.5, 0
        end_x, end_y = 0.75, 1
        local_t = (t - 0.5) / 0.25
        x = start_x + local_t * (end_x - start_x)
        y = start_y + local_t * (end_y - start_y)
    elif 0.75 <= t <= 1:
        # Segment 4: (0.75, 1) to (1, 0)
        start_x, start_y = 0.75, 1
        end_x, end_y = 1, 0
        local_t = (t - 0.75) / 0.25
        x = start_x + local_t * (end_x - start_x)
        y = start_y + local_t * (end_y - start_y)
    else:
        # Out of range t; handle the case where t is not within [0, 1]
        x, y = None, None

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 1)
```

This code defines the trajectory for drawing a capital 'W'. The `t` parameter ranges from 0 to 1, and the shape is divided into four segments that adjust the `x` and `y` coordinates accordingly for a seamless trajectory. Ensure `t` is uniformly distributed over the range [0, 1] for a continuous and smooth movement.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Number9: using a trajectory resembling the number '9'.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: ### Closed or Open Trajectory Decision

The trajectory resembling the number '9' is an **open trajectory**, as it does not form a completely closed loop.

### Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown (This step is simple, so skipping the breakdown)

### Trajectory Analysis

To draw the number '9', we can break it down into two main parts:
1. **The circular part**: This forms the top loop of the '9'.
2. **The tail part**: This descends vertically from the bottom of the loop.

To ensure smooth transitions and uniform speed, we will explicitly maintain continuity between the circular part and the tail.

### Mathematical Functions

Given this, let's define the mathematical function for the trajectory:

1. **Circular Part** (`0 <= t < pi`): This can be represented using the parametric equations of a circle (half-circle to be exact, starting from the top left going clockwise).
2. **Tail Part** (`pi <= t <= 2pi`): This is a simple vertical line starting from the end of the circular part.

Here's the code for the trajectory:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    import numpy as np
    if 0 <= t < np.pi:
        # Circular part
        r = 1  # radius of the circular part of 9
        x = r * np.cos(t)
        y = r * np.sin(t)
    elif np.pi <= t <= 2 * np.pi:
        # Tail part - starts where the circle ends
        start_x = -1
        start_y = 0
        end_y = -3  # length of the tail
        proportion = (t - np.pi) / np.pi  # Normalizing t to range [0, 1] for the tail part
        x = start_x
        y = start_y + (end_y - start_y) * proportion
    else:
        raise ValueError("t is out of range")
    
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 2 * np.pi)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Circular Part (`0 <= t < π`)**:
   - This segment represents a semi-circle with radius \( r = 1 \).
   - We use the parametric equations \( x = r \cos(t) \) and \( y = r \sin(t) \).

2. **Tail Part (`π <= t <= 2π`)**:
   - This segment starts from \( (-1, 0) \) and goes vertically down to \( (-1, -3) \).
   - We compute a linear transition for \( y \) while \( x \) remains constant at \( -1 \).

The function `shape_curve(t)` ensures smooth transitions between segments without sudden jumps, maintaining uniform speed across the entire range of \( t \).

User: 
**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.
再次强调：为了确保平滑过渡，您需要调整每一段段的公式，使其从上一段的终点坐标开始，而不是独立地重新定义 x 和 y。如果有不同的t段落，每一段的开始坐标和结束坐标应该在注释中标注出来！start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'CapitalPi: using a trajectory resembling the capital Greek letter 'Π' (Pi).'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: ### Trajectory Analysis and Decision

**Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:**

The trajectory of the capital Greek letter 'Π' (Pi) resembles an open path as it consists of an initial vertical line followed by a horizontal line on the top connecting to another vertical line and doesn't close back on itself.

**Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**

1. Walk straight up (vertical line).
2. At the top, turn right and walk to the right (horizontal line).
3. At the end, turn down and walk vertically (another vertical line).

### Trajectory Structure:

We'll break this into three parts to ensure smooth transitions between segments:

1. **First Segment (Vertical Line Up):**
    - Starts at (x=0, y=0)
    - Ends at (x=0, y=H)

2. **Second Segment (Horizontal Line Right):**
    - Starts at (x=0, y=H)
    - Ends at (x=W, y=H)

3. **Third Segment (Vertical Line Down):**
    - Starts at (x=W, y=H)
    - Ends at (x=W, y=0)

### Mathematical Functions:

We'll ensure smooth and uniform transitions across all segments.

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    H = 1      # Height of the Pi
    W = 1      # Width of the Pi

    if 0 <= t < 1/3:  # First Segment (Vertical Up)
        x = 0
        y = H * 3 * t    # From 0 to H in t-range (0, 1/3)
    elif 1/3 <= t < 2/3:  # Second Segment (Horizontal Right)
        x = W * 3 * (t - 1/3) # From 0 to W in t-range (1/3, 2/3)
        y = H
    elif 2/3 <= t <= 1:  # Third Segment (Vertical Down)
        x = W
        y = H - H * 3 * (t - 2/3) # From H to 0 in t-range (2/3, 1)

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 1)
```

### Explanation:

1. **First Segment:** The person walks vertically from (0, 0) to (0, H). 
   - \( x = 0 \)
   - \( y = H \times 3 \times t \), for \(t\) in \([0, 1/3)\)

2. **Second Segment:** The person then turns right and walks horizontally from (0, H) to (W, H).
   - \( x = W \times 3 \times (t - 1/3) \)
   - \( y = H \), for \(t\) in \([1/3, 2/3)\)

3. **Third Segment:** Finally, the person turns down and walks vertically from (W, H) to (W, 0).
   - \( x = W \)
   - \( y = H - H \times 3 \times (t - 2/3) \), for \(t\) in \([2/3, 1]\)

By structuring the trajectory in this format, we ensure smooth transitions and continuous movement throughout.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'ForwardAndBackward: using a forward and backward trajectory.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: Considering the provided description "ForwardAndBackward: using a forward and backward trajectory," we can visualize this trajectory as a person walking forward in a straight line and then reversing along the same path.

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** This trajectory is open since it consists of a forward and backward motion without forming a closed loop.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** We will model the trajectory with two segments. The person will first move forward along a straight line and then reverse back along the same path.

Here's the breakdown of the trajectory:
- First segment (0 ≤ t < 0.5): Move forward along the x-axis.
- Second segment (0.5 ≤ t ≤ 1): Move backward along the x-axis.

The movement will be uniform in both forward and backward directions. 

**Coordinate System:**
- Forward movement: From (0,0) to (1,0)
- Backward movement: From (1,0) back to (0,0)

Let's create the function:

**Code Format:**
```python
def shape_curve(t):
    if 0 <= t < 0.5:
        # Normalize t for the forward segment from 0 to 1
        normalized_t = t / 0.5
        x = normalized_t
        y = 0
    elif 0.5 <= t <= 1:
        # Normalize t for the backward segment from 0 to 1
        normalized_t = (t - 0.5) / 0.5
        x = 1 - normalized_t
        y = 0
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 1)
```

This function assumes that the trajectory moves uniformly along the x-axis, forward from (0,0) to (1,0) and then backward from (1,0) to (0,0), ensuring smooth transitions and maintenance of uniform speed over time.
extracted_code: def shape_curve(t):
    if 0 <= t < 0.5:

        x = normalized_t
        y = 0

        normalized_t = (t - 0.5) / 0.5

- "Move up to (2, 2)."
- "Move down to (3, 1)."

**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.
再次强调：为了确保平滑过渡，您需要调整每一段段的公式，使其从上一段的终点坐标开始，而不是独立地重新定义 x 和 y。如果有不同的t段落，每一段的开始坐标和结束坐标应该在注释中标注出来！start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Number9: using a trajectory resembling the number '9'.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: 1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory resembles the number '9', which is a closed shape returning to a starting point, making it a closed trajectory.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
   - The trajectory can be broken down into two parts:
     1. Create the loop of the '9'.
     2. Draw the straight line descending from the loop.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:**
   - For the number '9', we can represent it in two segments:
     1. The circular part of '9', which curves clockwise and returns to the starting point.
     2. The vertical line extending downward from the head of the '9'.
   - We will ensure smooth transitions from the curve to the straight line.

4. **Mathematical Functions:**
```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Define parameters for the circular part of '9'
    if t < np.pi:
        # Circular part for t from 0 to pi (loop)
        radius = 1  # Radius of the circle
        x = radius * np.cos(t) + 1  # Shifted to the right for visual placement
        y = radius * np.sin(t)  # Centered at the origin
    else:
        # Vertical line part for t from pi to 2*pi (downward)
        x = 2  # Fixed x position for the line going down
        y = -1 + (t - np.pi)  # Start just below the circle and goes downwards
    
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 2 * np.pi)
``` 

This representation ensures the curve transitions smoothly from the circular part to the straight line segment, maintaining continuity in both the x and y coordinates.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'CapitalPi: using a trajectory resembling the capital Greek letter 'Π' (Pi).'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: 1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory described resembles the capital Greek letter 'Π', which is a closed trajectory. The shape consists of two vertical lines and a horizontal base, intersecting at their endpoints, creating a defined loop.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
   - Draw the first vertical line down (left leg of 'Π').
   - Move horizontally to the right (top of 'Π').
   - Draw the second vertical line down (right leg of 'Π').

2.1 **Movement Breakdown:**
   - Start at (0, 0).
   - Move down vertically to (0, -2).
   - Move right horizontally to (2, -2).
   - Move down vertically to (2, -4).

3. **Trajectory Analysis:**
   Let's define two vertical segments and one horizontal segment. We'll ensure smooth transitions. Given that the movements are straight and align perfectly, we can generate a continuous function to represent this path.

   **Segment Breakdown:**
   - Segment 1: Move down from (0, 0) to (0, -2) for t in [0, 1].
   - Segment 2: Move right from (0, -2) to (2, -2) for t in [1, 2].
   - Segment 3: Move down from (2, -2) to (2, -4) for t in [2, 3].

   The coordinates smoothly transition from one segment to the next.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'ForwardAndBackward: using a forward and backward trajectory.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: ### 1. Closed or Open Trajectory Decision
The trajectory described is open because it involves a forward and backward movement along the same path rather than completing a geometric shape.

### 2. Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown
Given the description "ForwardAndBackward: using a forward and backward trajectory," we can break down the trajectory into simple actions as follows:

1. Move forward for a distance of `d` meters.
2. Move backward for the same distance of `d` meters.

### 3. Trajectory Analysis
1. **Forward Movement:** The person starts at the origin (0, 0) and moves forward by `d` meters. Assuming they are moving in the direction of "12 o'clock" (straight ahead), the new coordinates will be `(0, d)`.
2. **Backward Movement:** After reaching `(0, d)`, the person moves back to the starting point (0, 0).

This creates a linear trajectory along the y-axis while maintaining continuity and uniform speed.

### 4. Mathematical Functions
Now, we implement the trajectory function ensuring smooth transitions and specifying the coordinates for each segment:

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    # Forward movement: from (0, 0) to (0, d)
    d = 10  # Distance you can define
    if t < 0.5:
        x = 0
        y = d * t / 0.5  # Transition from 0 to d
    # Backward movement: from (0, d) to (0, 0)
    else:
        x = 0
        y = d * (1 - (t - 0.5) / 0.5)  # Transition from d to 0

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 1)
```

This code will create a trajectory where the person moves forward for half of the `t` range and then backward for the next half, resulting in a smooth and continuous path.

    # Forward movement: from (0, 0) to (0, d)

**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.
再次强调：为了确保平滑过渡，您需要调整每一段段的公式，使其从上一段的终点坐标开始，而不是独立地重新定义 x 和 y。如果有不同的t段落，每一段的开始坐标和结束坐标应该在注释中标注出来！start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Number9: using a trajectory resembling the number '9'.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: 1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory resembling the number '9' is open since it starts from a point, curves downwards, and slightly returns upwards but does not form a complete loop.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
   - Start at the top of the '9' and move downward to form a loop.
   - After completing the loop, continue slightly up to form the tail of the '9'.

   Here's a breakdown:
   - Start at (0, 2) --> Move downward in a curve to (1, 0)
   - Then move back up in a straight line to (0, 1)

   This can be summarized as:
   - **Step 1:** Curve downward to the right from (0, 2) to (1, 0)
   - **Step 2:** Move slightly upward to the left from (1, 0) to (0, 1)

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** 
   - The trajectory starts at (0, 2), curves downwards to (1, 0), then moves slightly back upward to (0, 1). 
   - The trajectory will require smooth transitions, ensuring no instant jumps between segments.
   - The start of the upward segment will align with the endpoint of the downward segment, ensuring a continuous path.

4. **Mathematical Functions:**
```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Parameters for the downward curve of '9'
    # From (0, 2) to (1, 0)
    x1 = 0.5 * np.cos(np.pi * t) + 0.5
    y1 = -np.abs(np.sin(np.pi * t)) + 2  # Downward curve

    # The transition point
    start_x1, start_y1 = 0, 2  # Starting point of the downward curve
    end_x1, end_y1 = 1, 0      # Ending point of the downward curve

    # Parameters for the upward line of '9'
    # From (1, 0) to (0, 1)
    x2 = (1 - t) * 1 + t * 0
    y2 = (1 - t) * 0 + t * 1  # Straight line upwards

    # Combine the results
    x = np.where(t <= 1, x1, x2)
    y = np.where(t <= 1, y1, y2)

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 2)  # 0 to 1 for curve, 1 to 2 for the upward line
```

This function smoothly transitions from forming the downward curve of '9' to the slight upward path without any abrupt movements.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'CapitalPi: using a trajectory resembling the capital Greek letter 'Π' (Pi).'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: 1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory resembling the capital Greek letter 'Π' (Pi) is open because it has two vertical lines and a horizontal line connecting them, not forming a closed shape.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
   - Start at the bottom left of the 'Π'.
   - Move vertically up to the top left.
   - Move horizontally to the right to the top right.
   - Move vertically down to the bottom right.
   - Move horizontally to the left back to the bottom left.

2.1 Breakdown of movements:
   - "Move up from (0, 0) to (0, 2)" (left vertical line)
   - "Move right from (0, 2) to (2, 2)" (top horizontal line)
   - "Move down from (2, 2) to (2, 0)" (right vertical line)
   - "Move left from (2, 0) to (0, 0)" (bottom horizontal line)

3. **Trajectory Analysis:**
   - The trajectory can be expressed in segments where the x and y coordinates shift uniformly.
   - The trajectory will consist of four segments, ensuring smooth transitions at each point. 
   - The transition from each segment's end to the next segment's start will maintain continuity.

4. **Mathematical Functions:**
```python
def shape_curve(t):
    # Define the motion segments
    if t < 0.25:  # From (0, 0) to (0, 2)
        x = 0
        y = 8 * t  # Changing from 0 to 2 (0 to 1 represents height of 2)
    elif t < 0.5:  # From (0, 2) to (2, 2)
        x = 8 * (t - 0.25)  # Changing from 0 to 2 (2 to 1 represents width of 2)
        y = 2
    elif t < 0.75:  # From (2, 2) to (2, 0)
        x = 2
        y = 2 - 8 * (t - 0.5)  # Changing from 2 to 0 (2 to 1 is a drop of 2)

        y = 0

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 1)
``` 

This will create a continuous trajectory resembling the capital Greek letter 'Π', moving smoothly through each defined segment.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'CapitalW: using a trajectory resembling the capital letter 'W'.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: 1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory representing a capital letter 'W' is open because it does not return to the starting point and does not form a closed loop.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
   - Start at the origin (0, 0).
   - Move diagonally up-right to (1, 1).
   - Move down to (0.5, 0).
   - Move diagonally up-left to (1.5, 1).
   - Move down to (1, 0).
   - Move diagonally up-right to (2, 1).
   - Finally, move down to (1.5, 0).

   Following this description, the movement can be summarized as:
   1. Start at (0, 0), go to (1, 1): "Move to point (1, 1)"
   2. Go down to (0.5, 0): "Move down to point (0.5, 0)"
   3. Go up-left to (1.5, 1): "Move to point (1.5, 1)"
   4. Go down to (1, 0): "Move down to point (1, 0)"
   5. Go up-right to (2, 1): "Move to point (2, 1)"
   6. End at (1.5, 0): "Move down to point (1.5, 0)"

3. **Trajectory Analysis:**
   Based on the movements, we can define the trajectory using linear segments. The trajectory has smooth transitions through well-defined start and end coordinates for each segment.

Model: 1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory representing the number '9' is an open trajectory as it doesn't loop back to the starting point.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
   - Start at the top of the loop of the '9'.
   - Move downwards to the bottom of the loop.
   - Move to the right to the bottom stem of the '9'.
   - Move upwards to represent the vertical stroke.
   - Complete the figure by returning to the starting point of the loop.

   - Move upwards to (0, 1) to finish the trajectory going back to the starting loop.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** To create a smooth transition for the shape resembling the number '9', we can define it in segments with parametric equations. We'll consider the loop and stem as two primary segments.

4. **Mathematical Functions:**
```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    if t < 0.5:  # Loop segment
        # First part: circular arc for the loop of the '9'
        theta = t * 2 * np.pi  # Full loop from 0 to pi
        x = np.sin(theta)  # x = sin(theta)
        y = 1 - (1 + np.cos(theta))  # y = lower y value to simulate downward arc
    else:  # Stem segment
        # Second part: vertical line for the stem of the '9'
        t_stem = (t - 0.5) * 2  # Normalize the time for the stem segment
        x = 0  # x-coordinate remains the same
        y = 0.5 - t_stem  # y goes from 0.5 to -1
    
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 1)
```

This code accurately represents a trajectory for drawing the shape of the number '9' with a smooth transition between segments and a consistent speed across the entire motion.

**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.
再次强调：为了确保平滑过渡，您需要调整每一段段的公式，使其从上一段的终点坐标开始，而不是独立地重新定义 x 和 y。如果有不同的t段落，每一段的开始坐标和结束坐标应该在注释中标注出来！start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'CapitalPi: using a trajectory resembling the capital Greek letter 'Π' (Pi).'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: 1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory resembles the capital Greek letter 'Π' (Pi), which is a closed shape, as the top part forms a horizontal line that's connected to the vertical lines on either side.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:** 
   - The letter 'Π' consists of:
     1. A horizontal line across the top.
     2. Vertical lines descending from each end of the horizontal line.

   - Breakdown:
     1. Start at (0, 0), move to (1, 0) (right).
     2. Start at (1, 0), move to (1, 1) (upward).
     3. Start at (0, 0), move to (0, 1) (upward).
     4. Move from (0, 1) to (1, 1) (right).

3. **Trajectory Analysis:**
   - The trajectory has overlapping parts where the vertical lines begin from the base of the 'Π' and connect at the top edge.
   - The function should ensure smooth transitions between segments and a uniform speed.

### Define the function with smooth transitions:

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    # Parameters to control the segments
    if t < 0.25:  # First segment: horizontal top (t from 0 to 0.25)
        x = 4 * t  # x ranges from 0 to 1
        y = 0      # y stays at 0
    elif t < 0.5:  # Second segment: vertical right side (t from 0.25 to 0.5)
        x = 1      # x stays at 1
        y = 4 * (t - 0.25)  # y ranges from 0 to 1
    elif t < 0.75:  # Third segment: vertical left side (t from 0.5 to 0.75)
        x = 0      # x stays at 0
        y = 4 * (t - 0.5)  # y ranges from 0 to 1
    else:  # Fourth segment: horizontal bottom (t from 0.75 to 1)
        x = 4 * (t - 0.75)  # x ranges from 0 to 1
        y = 1      # y stays at 1

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 1)
```

This code creates a smooth trajectory for the shape of the capital letter 'Π', ensuring that all segments transition smoothly without any abrupt shifts in coordinates.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Walk forward, then turn around and walk forward again, then turn (towards 10 o'clock) and continue walking .'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: Let's breakdown the trajectory described:

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The described path is open. It ends at a different point from where it starts.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
   - Walk forward for a certain distance.
   - Turn around 180 degrees, then walk forward again for the same distance.
   - Turn towards 10 o'clock (left and slightly forward) and continue walking.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** 
    - The trajectory starts by walking straight.
    - A 180-degree turn means walking back on the same path.
    - When the person turns towards 10 o'clock, it's a turn towards the left front (30 degrees counterclockwise).

The trajectory consists of three segments, where the movement should be consistent in speed across the path. We'll ensure transitions are smooth.

Now, let's define the trajectory mathematically. Assume the initial distance for simplicity is 1 unit (you can scale accordingly).

We need to have a function `shape_curve(t)` that smoothly transitions between these segments.

**Segments Details:**
1. Walk forward for `0 <= t < 1` (start_x, start_y = 0,0 -> end_x, end_y = 1,0)
2. Walk backward after 180-degree turn for `1 <= t < 2` (start_x, start_y = 1,0 -> end_x, end_y = 0,0)
3. Walk towards 10 o'clock for `2 <= t <= 3` (start_x, start_y = 0,0 -> end_x = \( \cos(\pi/6), \sin(\pi/6) \))

Let's implement this:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    if 0 <= t < 1:
        # Walk forward
        x = t
        y = 0
    elif 1 <= t < 2:
        # Turn around and walk forward again (effectively backward)
        x = 1 - (t - 1)
        y = 0
    elif 2 <= t <= 3:
        # Turn and walk towards 10 o'clock direction, 30 degrees (π/6 radians) left
        length_after_turn = t - 2
        x = (1 - 1) + length_after_turn * np.cos(np.pi / 6)
        y = (0 - 0) + length_after_turn * np.sin(np.pi / 6)
    
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 3)
```

In this code, we establish three segments with transitions happening at t=1 and t=2, ensuring smooth and continuous trajectory following the path described. The uniform speed over time ensures smooth transitions with each segment starting where the previous one ended.

def shape_curve(t):
    if 0 <= t < 1:
        # Walk forward
        x = t

    elif 1 <= t < 2:
        # Turn around and walk forward again (effectively backward)
        x = 1 - (t - 1)
        y = 0
    elif 2 <= t <= 3:
        # Turn and walk towards 10 o'clock direction, 30 degrees (π/6 radians) left

        x = (1 - 1) + length_after_turn * np.cos(np.pi / 6)

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Walk in a figure-eight pattern.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: ### Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:
- The described trajectory "figure-eight pattern" suggests that it is a closed trajectory.

### Trajectory Analysis:
- The figure-eight pattern can be represented mathematically as two loops merged at a central point. 
- For simplicity, we will approximate the figure-eight using a parametric equation.

### Mathematical Functions:
- The figure-eight pattern can be parameterized using functions involving sine and cosine. A common mathematical representation is the lemniscate of Gerono.

Here is the code to describe the figure-eight pattern as a continuous trajectory:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    x = np.sin(t)
    y = np.sin(t) * np.cos(t)
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 2 * np.pi)
```
### Explanation:
- The `shape_curve(t)` function uses parametric equations to define x and y coordinates as a function of `t`.
- The range of `t` is from 0 to \(2\pi\), ensuring one complete traversal of the figure-eight pattern.

Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Walk forward, then turn around and walk forward again, then turn (towards 10 o'clock) and continue walking .'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: 1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory is open since it involves walking forward, turning around, and then turning again to continue walking in a new direction.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
   - Step 1: Walk forward for some distance (let's say 5 meters).
   - Step 2: Turn around (180 degrees) and walk forward for the same distance (5 meters).
   - Step 3: Turn left towards 10 o'clock (approximately -30 degrees from the original direction) and walk forward (let's say 3 meters).

2.1 Each segment will be straightforward to avoid complexity.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** We'll calculate positions based on a uniform speed of movement. The trajectory will consist of three segments:
   - Segment 1: From (0, 0) to (0, 5)
   - Segment 2: From (0, 5) to (0, 0) [turn around]
   - Segment 3: From (0, 0) to (-2.6, 2.6) [turn to 10 o'clock and walk forward]

Each segment will start from the endpoint of the previous segment.

### Segment Breakdown:
1. **Segment 1: Forward (0,0) to (0,5)** 
   - \( x_1(t) = 0 \)
   - \( y_1(t) = t \) for \( t \) in \([0, 5]\)

2. **Segment 2: Backward (0,5) to (0,0)**
   - \( x_2(t) = 0 \)
   - \( y_2(t) = 5 - t \) for \( t \) in \([5, 10]\)

3. **Segment 3: Turn and walk to (-2.6, 2.6)**
   - Start from (0,0) to the new direction (-2.6, 2.6) 
   - The angle to 10 o'clock is about 30 degrees, which gives us a distance of 3 meters.
   - The movement can be represented in this parametrization, where \( t \) goes from 10 to 13 (for 3 meters).
   - \( x_3(t) = -3 * cos(30^\circ) \cdots t = t - 10 \)
   - \( y_3(t) = 3 * sin(30^\circ) \cdots t = t - 10 \)

### Final Trajectory Code:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    if 0 <= t < 5:
        # Segment 1: Forward (0,0) to (0,5)
        x = 0
        y = t  # From 0 to 5
    elif 5 <= t < 10:
        # Segment 2: Backward (0,5) to (0,0)
        x = 0
        y = 5 - (t - 5)  # From 5 to 0
    elif 10 <= t < 13:
        # Segment 3: Moving towards (-2.6, 2.6)
        t_segment = t - 10  # Local t for segment 3
        # Calculate coordinates in the new direction
        x = -3 * np.cos(np.radians(30)) * t_segment / 3  # Corresponding x in segment 3
        y = 3 * np.sin(np.radians(30)) * t_segment / 3  # Corresponding y in segment 3
    else:
        x = 0
        y = 0  # Out of bounds case, keep it at origin or handle it otherwise

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 13)
```

This implementation provides a clear trajectory based on the described actions with smooth transitions and a uniform speed throughout the segments.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Walk in a figure-eight pattern.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: 1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory is closed since a figure-eight pattern forms a continuous loop.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
   - The figure-eight pattern can be broken down into two overlapping loops. The first loop goes up and right, and then down and to the left; the second loop goes up and left, and then down and to the right.

2.1. Each loop can be described using parametric equations:
   - Loop 1 (right loop): Start from the center (0, 0), move in a circular path up and to the right then down and left.
   - Loop 2 (left loop): From the same center (0, 0), move in a circular path up and to the left then down and right.

For simplicity, let's define the radius of the loops as 1 unit. The trajectory can be defined as follows:
- For t from 0 to π: Move in the first loop (right loop).
- For t from π to 2π: Move in the second loop (left loop).

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** 
- The loops meet at the center, making sure there is a smooth transition at these meeting points. 
- The movement should remain consistent and continuous throughout the described trajectory.

4. **Mathematical Functions:**

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Define the parameters for the figure-eight pattern
    a = 1  # radius of the loops

    # First loop (right loop)
    if t < np.pi:
        x = a * np.sin(t)
        y = a * np.sin(2 * t)
    
    # Second loop (left loop)
    else:
        t_adjusted = t - np.pi  # Adjust t for the second loop
        x = a * np.sin(t_adjusted)
        y = -a * np.sin(2 * t_adjusted)
    
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 2 * np.pi)
```

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Climb a spiral staircase.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: 1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory of climbing a spiral staircase is considered closed, as it involves continuous motion around an axis, returning to the starting point visually in a circular manner, but it is not closed in a geometrical sense since it can lead upwards indefinitely.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
   To represent climbing a spiral staircase, we can simplify the action into a circular path while simultaneously moving upwards. The breakdown can be as follows:
   - Start at a certain height (z = 0).
   - Move in a circular motion while increasing height.
   
   This can be described in terms of angle (representing the circular motion) and height increment.

2.1 Since this description encompasses the circular motion of the staircase along with the vertical movement, we will represent it mathematically.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** 
   The trajectory will involve both circular motion (in the x-y plane) and vertical motion (along the z-axis). It will be continuously moving with respect to an angle `theta` (which will vary with time `t`). To account for continuity and ensure that segments are smoothly connected, we shall make x and y depend on a sine and cosine function, while a linear equation increases the height over time.

4. **Mathematical Functions:**
   
```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    radius = 1  # Fixed radius for the spiral
    height_per_turn = 2  # Height increase per full rotation
    turns = 3  # Total turns; you can modify this to make it taller or shorter
    
    # Compute the angle based on time to complete 'turns' in 't_range' time
    theta = (2 * np.pi * turns * t)  # Complete turns in time 't'
    
    # Circular motion
    x = radius * np.cos(theta)  # x = r * cos(theta)
    y = radius * np.sin(theta)  # y = r * sin(theta)
    
    # Height, z increases linearly with time
    z = (height_per_turn / (2 * np.pi * turns)) * theta  # Linear rise over time

    return x, y, z

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 1)  # Modify as necessary; representing 0 to 1 second.
```

In this function, `theta` is computed based on how many turns you want over the specified time. The spiral staircase trajectory is represented with a circular motion in the x-y plane while ascending in the z dimension. The calculations ensure a smooth transition with uniform speed throughout the path.

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.

Model: 1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The described trajectory, "Walk in a figure-eight pattern," is a **closed trajectory** because it forms a complete loop.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
   - Start at the center of the figure-eight.
   - Move to the left in a semi-circle (upper loop).
   - Move downwards to the right in a semi-circle (lower loop).
   - Return to the starting point, completing the figure-eight.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** The figure-eight pattern can be represented mathematically by two overlapping circles. Each segment should smoothly connect without abrupt transitions. The trajectories will overlap around the intersection points of the circles.

Here’s an outline of the trajectory:
- The first half will follow a circular path to the left (upper loop).
- The second half will be a circular path to the right (lower loop).
- We will transition smoothly between these segments.

**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Walk in a figure-eight pattern.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: 1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory is closed because a figure-eight pattern ultimately connects back to the starting point, resembling a loop.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
   - Walk in a clockwise figure-eight shape, essentially tracing two circles that intersect at the center.
   - Begin by tracing the first loop to the right, then transition to trace the left loop, ensuring a smooth transition at the intersection.

2.1 Breakdown of the movement:
   - Start at origin (0, 0).
   - Move in a circular path to the right for half of the figure-eight (first loop).
   - Cross over to the left and trace the second loop back down.
   - Return to the intersection smoothly before completing the figure-eight.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** 
   - The first loop will generally follow a path around the coordinates creating a smooth arc.
   - The width of the figure-eight will be proportional to the distance between the two loops (let's say, 2 meters).
   - To provide smooth transitions, each segment will align with the end of its previous path without jumps.

To map this into the function, we will define the first half of the figure-eight, and then we will reflect the second half accordingly.

Here's the code for the trajectory:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Define the radius and center of the figure-eight
    a = 1  # The semi-major axis
    b = 2  # The semi-minor axis
    
    # Create the figure-eight pattern
    # First loop: 0 <= t < π (first circle)
    # Second loop: π <= t < 2π (second circle)
    
    if 0 <= t < np.pi:
        # Equation of the first loop
        x = a * np.sin(t)
        y = b * np.sin(2 * t)  # Creating the figure-eight shape
    elif np.pi <= t < 2 * np.pi:
        # Equation of the second loop
        x = a * np.sin(2 * t - np.pi)  # Shift to the left loop
        y = b * np.sin(4 * t - 2 * np.pi)  # Continuation of the figure-eight shape
    else:
        # Outside the expected range, we can define a "rest" position or return previous values.
        x = 0
        y = 0

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 2 * np.pi)
```

- The figure-eight trajectory is smoothly defined using parametric equations to ensure uniform speed and continuity.
- The radius of the figure-eight and height for the loops can be adjusted by changing `a` and `b`.

Model: 1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory is closed because a figure-eight pattern connects back to its starting point, forming a complete loop.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
   - **Step 1:** Start at (0, 0)
   - **Step 2:** Move in a clockwise circle to form the upper loop of the figure-eight.
   - **Step 3:** Descend to the center of the figure-eight.
   - **Step 4:** Move in a clockwise circle to form the lower loop of the figure-eight.
   - **Step 5:** Return to the starting point.

2.1 **Breaking down into segments:**
   - For the upper loop:
     - Move from (0, 0) to the top of the loop.
   - For the lower loop:
     - Move from the bottom of the upper loop to the bottom of the lower loop.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** The figure-eight can be described as two overlapping circles. Each circle has a radius, and the figure-eight is symmetric. We will smoothly transition from one loop to the other without sudden jumps.

Here’s the trajectory setup:
- The upper loop can be represented by the equation of a circle, and the lower loop will have a similar equation but shifted down. We'll employ sine and cosine functions to ensure smooth transitions, and we'll use a parameterization for the loops.

4. **Mathematical Functions:**

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Define the radius and vertical shift for the loops
    r = 1  # Radius of the circles
    k = 0.5  # Vertical offset between loops
    
    # For 0 <= t < π (first loop), upper half of the figure-eight
    # start_x: (0, 0) -> end_x: (0, r)
    if t < np.pi:
        x = r * np.sin(t)  # Upper loop in x dimension
        y = r * np.cos(t)  # Upper loop in y dimension
    # For π <= t < 2π (second loop), lower half of the figure-eight
    # start_x: (0, r) -> end_x: (0, -r)
    else:
        t_adj = t - np.pi
        x = r * np.sin(t_adj)  # Lower loop in x dimension
        y = -r * np.cos(t_adj) + k  # Lower loop in y dimension, shifted down

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 2 * np.pi)
```

This code will produce the figure-eight trajectory, leveraging the properties of sinusoidal functions to ensure continuity and uniform speed as the parameter `t` progresses from 0 to \(2\pi\).

"I want to draw a Description = 'Walk in a figure-eight pattern.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: 1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory described as "Walk in a figure-eight pattern" is a closed trajectory, as it loops back on itself and returns to the starting point.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:** The figure-eight pattern can be broken down into two lobes. Here is a simple breakdown of the movements:

   - Start at (0, 0).
   - Move in a loop to the right in an upward arc, reaching a peak at around (1, 1) as it goes to the right.
   - Transition smoothly into a downward arc that returns back through (0, 0) and goes left, reaching a similar height, creating the left part of the figure-eight, until reaching (-1, 1).
   - Return downwards to (0, 0) again and then continue to complete the right lobe of the figure-eight back to (1, 1).
   - The trajectory is a symmetric path that goes back and forth in a continuous cycle.

2.1 Keeping it accurate and straightforward, we can represent this motion in parameterized form using sine and cosine functions to ensure smooth transitions.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** The figure-eight can be visualized as two overlapping circles or ellipses. We will parameterize the curve with `t` going from 0 to 2π for each loop and adjust the frequency accordingly to create the figure-eight pattern while maintaining a uniform speed of movement.

**Mathematical Functions:** The trajectory will consist of two parts:
- From `(0, 0)` moving to `(1, 1)`.
- Back to `(0, 0)` then moving to `(-1, 1)` and back, creating the complete figure-eight.

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Defining the figure-eight parametric equations
    x = np.sin(t) * (2 * np.cos(t / 2))
    y = np.cos(t) * (2 * np.sin(t / 2))
    
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 2 * np.pi)
```

- The `x` and `y` movements are defined so that they start from (0, 0) at `t = 0`, reach (1, 1) at `t = π/2`, and complete the figure-eight shape correctly as `t` varies from `0` to `2π` with smooth transitions.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Walk in a figure-eight pattern.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: 1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory described as "Walk in a figure-eight pattern" is closed since it eventually returns to the starting position to complete the figure-eight shape.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
   - **Step 1:** Start at point (0, 0), and walk upward in a curve.
   - **Step 2:** Complete the first loop of the figure-eight.
   - **Step 3:** Transition downwards and curve back up to form the second loop of the figure-eight.
   - **Step 4:** Return to the starting point, completing the figure-eight.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** 
   - For a figure-eight, we can describe it mathematically using a combination of sine and cosine functions. The loops can be represented with a transformation over the range of `t`. 
   - The parameterization will ensure that the trajectory forms a smooth continuous shape, maintaining a consistent speed.

4. **Mathematical Functions:** 
Here’s how to define the `shape_curve(t)` function that represents the figure-eight trajectory:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Define the parameters for the figure-eight shape
    a = 1  # Scale factor for loops

    # The figure-eight can be represented using parametric equations:
    x = a * np.sin(t) * (1 + np.cos(t))  # X-coordinate
    y = a * np.sin(t) * np.cos(t)        # Y-coordinate

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
t_range = (0, 2 * np.pi)  # Complete one figure-eight
```

This code implements the figure-eight pattern smoothly, ensuring all movements connect without abrupt transitions.

**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.
再次强调：为了确保平滑过渡，您需要调整每一段段的公式，使其从上一段的终点坐标开始，而不是独立地重新定义 x 和 y。如果有不同的t段落，每一段的开始坐标和结束坐标应该在注释中标注出来！start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y

"I want to draw a Description = 'Walk in a figure-eight pattern.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: 1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory is closed since a figure-eight pattern meets back on itself, creating a continuous loop.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
   - Start at the origin (0, 0).
   - Move in a clockwise direction, forming the first loop of the figure-eight.
   - Transition smoothly to the second loop of the figure-eight.

**Breaking down the movement:**
- **First Loop:**
  - From (0, 0), go right for 1 meter.
  - Curve upwards to a peak at (1, 1), then return to (0, 0).
  
- **Second Loop:**
  - From (0, 0), go left for 1 meter.
  - Curve downwards to a peak at (-1, 1), then return to (0, 0).

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** To draw a figure-eight, we can utilize parametric equations across the range of `t` where it forms smooth loops. Each loop can be combined using sine and cosine functions to ensure a smooth trajectory.

- The figure-eight pattern can be represented using the following equations:
  - First loop: 
    - x1(t) = sin(t)
    - y1(t) = sin(2*t)/2
  - Second loop: 
    - x2(t) = sin(t + π)
    - y2(t) = sin(2*(t + π))/2 

These equations will create a continuous path as we're transitioning smoothly between the two loops.

4. **Mathematical Functions:**
```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # First loop
    if t < np.pi:
        x = np.sin(t)
        y = np.sin(2 * t) / 2
    # Second loop
    else:
        t_trans = t - np.pi  # Transition for the second loop
        x = np.sin(t_trans)
        y = np.sin(2 * t_trans) / 2
        
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 2 * np.pi)

This code defines a figure-eight trajectory where we smoothly transition between the two loops, creating a continuous and closed path.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Walk in a figure-eight pattern.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: 1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory is closed since a figure-eight pattern forms a complete loop.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:** 
   - Walk forward for 2 meters.
   - Curve left in a semicircle for 1 meter (downward part of the figure eight).
   - Walk straight for 2 meters (crossing the center).
   - Curve right in a semicircle for 1 meter (upward part of the figure eight).
   - Return to start.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** 
   The figure-eight pattern can be thought of as two loops stacked vertically. The movement should consist of smooth semicircular motions and straight lines that transition between these curves. We can represent the horizontal and vertical coordinates using sine and cosine functions to mimic the circular parts of the figure-eight.

To ensure continuity and to avoid instant jumps, the start coordinates for each segment must connect to the end coordinates of the previous segment. 

The path can be broken down into two parts for the left and right loops of the figure-eight.

4. **Mathematical Functions:** 

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Total trajectory time is divided into three segments:
    # Segment 1: Left loop: t in [0, π]
    # Segment 2: Cross: t in [π, 2π]

    if t < np.pi:  # First half of the figure-eight (left loop)
        # start_x, start_y = (0, 0), end_x, end_y will be (1, -0.5)
        x = np.sin(t)  # Horizontal motion
        y = np.cos(t) - 0.5  # Vertical motion adjusted downwards for the first loop
    elif t < 2 * np.pi:  # Crossing part of the figure-eight
        # start_x, start_y = (1, -0.5), end_x, end_y will be (1, 0.5)
        t_adjusted = t - np.pi  # Adjust t to map to this range
        x = 1  # Constant x during the crossing
        y = np.cos(t_adjusted) + 0.5  # Return to center line
    else:  # Second half of the figure-eight (right loop)
        # start_x, start_y = (1, 0.5), end_x, end_y will be (0, 0)

Model: 1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory described as "Walk in a figure-eight pattern" is a closed trajectory since it loops back onto itself.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:** While the figure-eight pattern can be complex, we can simplify it into two main loops (the upper and lower lobes of the figure-eight). Each lobe will span a simple elliptical shape.

2.1 The breakdown for the movement in a figure-eight pattern can be represented as follows:
- Start at the origin (0, 0).
- Move to the right and create the upper curve of the left lobe.
- Move vertically down to create the bottom of the left lobe.
- Move to the right to create the upper curve of the right lobe.
- Move vertically down to complete the bottom of the right lobe.
- Return to the starting position.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** The figure-eight trajectory can be expressed in parametric equations for two overlapping ellipses. We will represent the upper and lower lobes using sine and cosine functions to ensure smooth transitions and continuous movement without instant jumps.

- The first lobe (upper) will start from (0, 0) and will consist of horizontal and vertical movements forming an elliptical shape.
- The second lobe (lower) will use similar parametric functions but shifted vertically.

4. **Mathematical Functions:** Below is the final code that generates the trajectory for a figure-eight shape:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Coefficients for the figure-eight pattern
    a = 1  # horizontal scale
    b = 0.5  # vertical scale
     
    # Calculate the coordinates for the upper lobe of the figure-eight
    if t < np.pi:
        # Upper lobe (0 to π)
        x = a * np.sin(t)
        y = b * np.cos(t)
    else:
        # Lower lobe (π to 2π)
        t_shifted = t - np.pi
        x = a * np.sin(t_shifted)
        y = -b * np.cos(t_shifted)
    
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (0 to 2π for one full figure-eight pattern)
t_range = (0, 2 * np.pi)
```

This code structure generates a smooth figure-eight pattern, with x and y coordinates changing uniformly over time, ensuring a continuous trajectory with no sudden jumps. Adjustments in the parabola's vertical scaling maintain the classic figure-eight shape.

Model: 1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory is closed as it describes a figure-eight pattern, which returns to the starting point.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
   - Walk forward in a small circle, back to the center. 
   - Walk forward in a second circle that overlaps the first, forming a figure-eight.

2.1. Since the figure-eight has a clear circular component, I'll represent the trajectory as a parametric equation formed by two overlapping circles.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:**
   - The figure-eight consists of two loops, both centered at the same midpoint but having an offset (one to the right and one to the left).
   - The radius of the circles will determine the size of the figure-eight.
   - We will smooth the transitions, ensuring that the end of the first loop seamlessly connects with the beginning of the second loop.

Assuming that:
- The center point is (0, 0)
- The radius for the loops is 1
- Each loop is represented by a complete cycle over a range of `t`

### Given Parameters:
- Let’s say the parameter `t` runs from 0 to \(2\pi\) for one loop. Therefore, the whole figure-eight will cover `t` from 0 to \(4\pi\).

**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.
再次强调：为了确保平滑过渡，您需要调整每一段段的公式，使其从上一段的终点坐标开始，而不是独立地重新定义 x 和 y。如果有不同的t段落，每一段的开始坐标和结束坐标应该在注释中标注出来！start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Walk in a figure-eight pattern.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: 1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory described by "Walk in a figure-eight pattern." is a closed trajectory since a figure-eight loops back on itself.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
   - Walk forward in a circular path to form the upper loop of the figure-eight.
   - Transition downward to create the lower loop of the figure-eight while crossing the center.
   - Complete the lower loop and return to the starting position.

2.1 **Breakdown of Steps:**
   - Step 1: Start at (0, 0). 
   - Step 2: Describe the upper loop from (0, 0) to (1, 1) following a circular path and then back to (0, 0).
   - Step 3: Transition to the lower loop starting from (0, 0) to (-1, -1) in a similar circular path back to (0, 0).
   - Note: Each loop will smoothly transition through the intersection at the center.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:**
   - Define the upper loop of the figure-eight. For this, we can describe it using a parametric form.
   - The upper part can be represented using a sine and cosine function, which will create a loop.
   - The same will apply for the lower part but inverted vertically to reflect the different position.

**Mathematical Functions:**
```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Define the loop's radius
    radius = 1

    # Time normalization for the loops
    # Each loop runs over an interval of t/2
    if t < np.pi:  # Upper loop
        x = radius * np.sin(t)   # Start from (0,0) to (1, 1) and back to (0,0)
        y = radius * np.cos(t)   # Upper loop
    else:  # Lower loop
        t -= np.pi  # Start second loop
        x = radius * np.sin(t)   # Continuing from (0,0) to (-1, -1) back to (0,0)
        y = -radius * np.cos(t)  # Lower loop is inverted

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Walk in a figure-eight pattern.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: 1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory is closed because a figure-eight pattern brings the person back to the starting point.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:** 
   - **Segment 1:** Start from the origin (0,0) and move to the right, tracing the upper loop of the figure-eight.
   - **Segment 2:** Curve downwards to form the bottom part of the first loop.
   - **Segment 3:** Move back to the left, tracing the left side of the upper loop.
   - **Segment 4:** Curve downwards again to form the bottom part of the second loop.
   - **Segment 5:** Move back to the right to complete the figure-eight pattern.

2.1 **Movement Breakdown:**
   - Start at (0, 0).
   - Move right in an upward arc for the upper loop.
   - Curve down to the left to complete the upper loop.
   - Move left in an upward arc for the lower loop.
   - Curve back down to right to complete the lower loop.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** 
The figure-eight can be broken down into sine and cosine functions to achieve its smooth shapes. The horizontal and vertical components can change uniformly using trigonometric functions, ensuring continuous movement without abrupt shifts. We'll adjust the function for each segment so that they connect seamlessly.

Let's define the trajectories:

- For the upper loop (t from 0 to π): 
  - \( x_1(t) = a \cdot \sin(t) \)
  - \( y_1(t) = a \cdot \cos(t) \)
  
- For the lower loop (t from π to 2π):
  - \( x_2(t) = a \cdot \sin(t)\)
  - \( y_2(t) = -a \cdot \cos(t)\)

Both equations need to connect smoothly. The end of the first half of the loop starts where the second half begins.

4. **Mathematical Functions:**

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    a = 1  # amplitude for the loops
    if 0 <= t < np.pi:

        x = a * np.sin(t)

        # Lower loop

Model: 1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory is closed because a figure-eight pattern returns to the original starting point, creating a loop.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
   - Start at the origin (0, 0).
   - Move in a circular path to create the top loop of the figure-eight.
   - Transition smoothly to the bottom loop.
   - Complete the figure-eight by returning to the starting point.

2.1 Given the nature of the figure-eight, we can simplify it into two loops. The first loop can be described as moving in a circular path, and the second loop just below it, forming the lower part of the figure-eight.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:**
   The figure-eight pattern can be represented with parametric equations. We'll use sine and cosine functions to generate smooth circular motions for both loops. The trajectory overlaps at the center (0, 0), ensuring continuity in the path.

4. **Mathematical Functions:**
Here is the code that provides the required figure-eight trajectory:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # First loop of the figure-eight
    if t < np.pi:  # First half of the figure-eight (from 0 to π)
        x = 2 * np.sin(t)        # x-coordinates
        y = np.sin(2 * t)        # y-coordinates
    else:                       # Second half of the figure-eight (from π to 2π)
        t -= np.pi              # Shift t to start at 0 for the second loop
        x = 2 * np.sin(t)        # x-coordinates
        y = -np.sin(2 * t)       # y-coordinates (inverted for the second loop)

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)

Model: 1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory of "walking in a figure-eight pattern" is a closed trajectory as it forms a loop that returns to the starting point.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:** 
   - Start at (0, 0).
   - Move in a clockwise figure-eight pattern.
   - The pattern consists of two overlapping circles.

2.1 Simplified Steps:
- Move to the right (4) to (4, 0).
- Move in a circle (approximate a quarter circle) to (4, 2).
- Move to the left (4) to (0, 2).
- Move in a circle to (0, 0).
- Continue to the left (4) to (-4, 0).
- Move in a circle to (-4, -2).
- Move to the right (4) to (0, -2).
- Move in a circle back to (0, 0).

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** The figure-eight can be represented mathematically using trigonometric functions to describe its shape. Each loop will have a radius, and both loops can be captured using sine and cosine.

4. **Mathematical Functions:** Below is the code that represents the figure-eight trajectory.

1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Triangle: using a trajectory that forms an equilateral triangle.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: 1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory is closed because it forms a geometric figure, specifically an equilateral triangle.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
   - Start at point A (0, 0).
   - Move to point B (1, √3/2) — this is the top of the triangle.
   - Move to point C (2, 0) — this is the bottom right point.
   - Move back to point A (0, 0) — closing the triangle.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:**
   - To ensure uniform speed across the entire trajectory, we can divide the total distance into equal time segments.
   - The lengths of the triangle's sides can be calculated as the distance between the points, and each movement will smoothly transition to the next without abrupt shifts.

   The coordinates of the vertices of the equilateral triangle can be stated as:
   - A(0, 0) - Start
   - B(1, √3/2) - Top
   - C(2, 0) - Bottom right

   We will divide the total trajectory into three segments: from A to B, from B to C, and from C to A.

4. **Mathematical Functions:**

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Each segment will take up 1/3 of the time (t = 0 to t = 1, 1 to 2, and 2 to 3)
    if t < 1:  # Segment A to B
        # Coordinates from A (0, 0) to B (1, sqrt(3)/2)
        x = t
        y = (np.sqrt(3)/2) * t
    elif t < 2:  # Segment B to C
        # Coordinates from B (1, sqrt(3)/2) to C (2, 0)
        x = 1 + (t - 1)
        y = (np.sqrt(3)/2) * (2 - t)
    else:  # Segment C to A
        # Coordinates from C (2, 0) back to A (0, 0)
        x = 2 - (t - 2)
        y = 0

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 3)
```

This code will generate a smooth trajectory that forms an equilateral triangle. The movements are continuous, ensuring there are no abrupt shifts between segments, and the speed is uniform.

**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Spiral: using a trajectory that forms a spiral starting from the center and moving outward.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: 1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The described trajectory is open, as it is a spiral that continuously expands outward rather than returning to its starting point.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:** In this case, since the description is a simple spiral, we won't need to break it down into steps.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** The spiral will start from a central point and progressively move outward. The mathematical representation of a spiral can be defined using polar coordinates, which can then be converted to Cartesian coordinates.

4. **Mathematical Functions:** 

Here's the code implementing a simple spiral trajectory:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Define parameters for the spiral
    a = 0.1  # Controls the distance between the coils
    theta = t  # Angle in radians

    # Convert polar to Cartesian coordinates
    x = a * theta * np.cos(theta)  # x = r*cos(theta)
    y = a * theta * np.sin(theta)  # y = r*sin(theta)

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 10 * np.pi)  # The spiral will make several loops
```

This will create a continuous outward spiral trajectory. Adjust the parameters as needed to change the appearance of the spiral.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Semicircle: using a trajectory that forms a half-circle.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: 1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory is closed because a semicircle represents a continuous curve that returns to its starting point.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:** 
   For a semicircle, we can define the movement as follows:
   - Start from the leftmost point of the semicircle, move rightward to the midpoint at the top of the semicircle, and then continue moving to the rightmost point. This implies a simple left to right motion forming a half-circle.

2.1 Since the trajectory is straightforward (a semicircle), there's no need for a complex breakdown.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** 
   The semicircle's trajectory can be expressed using trigonometric functions. We can use the parameter `t` to represent the angle (in radians) from 0 to π (3.14...), which will trace half the circle.

   - From 0 to π, the trajectory will start at (-r, 0), go to (0, r), and finally to (r, 0), where r is the radius of the semicircle.

   To ensure continuity:
   - Start Position: (-r, 0)
   - Mid Position: (0, r)
   - End Position: (r, 0)

4. **Mathematical Functions:** 
   Here is how we can define the semicircle in Python:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t, r=1):  # r is the radius of the semicircle
    # Calculate x and y coordinates for the semicircle
    x = r * np.cos(t)         # x starts at -r, ends at r
    y = r * np.sin(t)         # y varies from 0 to r
    
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (0 to π for a semicircle)
t_range = (0, np.pi)
```

This code will accurately generate the coordinates for a semi-circular trajectory based on the parameter `t`.

"I want to draw a Description = 'Inverse_N: using a trajectory of an inverse 'N' shape.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: 1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory described as an inverse 'N' shape is open. It is not a closed geometric figure and does not involve walking a complete loop.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
   - Start at the bottom left corner. 
   - Move diagonally up to the top right corner (to form the vertical stroke).
   - Move horizontally to the left at the top.
   - Move diagonally down to form the bottom right stroke (returning back down to the original starting height).

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement: 
   - Move from (0, 0) to (0, 2) [upwards vertical stroke].
   - Move from (0, 2) to (1, 2) [horizontal stroke].
   - Move from (1, 2) to (0, 0) [downwards diagonal stroke].

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** The trajectory can be visualized as moving from point to point while ensuring there are smooth transitions between segments. The movement will proceed upward, horizontally, and then downward while maintaining uniform speed of movement.

- The trajectory portions are defined as follows:
   - Segment 1: Vertical up from (0, 0) to (0, 2)
   - Segment 2: Horizontal right from (0, 2) to (1, 2)
   - Segment 3: Diagonal down from (1, 2) to (0, 0)

### Movement coordinates:
- For Segment 1:
  - **Start:** (0, 0), **End:** (0, 2)
- For Segment 2:
  - **Start:** (0, 2), **End:** (1, 2)
- For Segment 3:
  - **Start:** (1, 2), **End:** (0, 0)

The mathematical functions will use a parameter `t` to smoothly transition through these points.

"I want to draw a Description = 'Zigzag: using a zigzag trajectory.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: 1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory is open. A zigzag path typically does not return to the starting point.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
   - Walk diagonally to the right up for a length of 1 meter (forward).
   - Walk diagonally to the left down for a length of 1 meter (backward).
   - Repeat the previous two steps several times.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** The zigzag trajectory consists of a series of segments that alternate between moving right-up and left-down. Each segment maintains a consistent length and direction from the previous segment while ensuring smooth transitions.

4. **Mathematical Functions:** Below is the implementation that reflects the zigzag trajectory, with adjustments for smooth transitions between segments.

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    # The trajectory consists of zigzagging segments.
    # Each zigzag segment is 1 unit long, and there are alternating moves.
    
    # Find the segment number
    segment_number = int(t // 2)  # Each segment is 2 units of 't'

**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.
再次强调：为了确保平滑过渡，您需要调整每一段段的公式，使其从上一段的终点坐标开始，而不是独立地重新定义 x 和 y。如果有不同的t段落，每一段的开始坐标和结束坐标应该在注释中标注出来！start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'CapitalJ: using a trajectory resembling the capital letter 'J'.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: 1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory resembles the capital letter 'J', which is an open shape.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:** 
   - Start at the top (point of 'J'), move downwards to form the straight part of the 'J'.
   - Then curve around to form the bottom semi-circle of the 'J'.

   - Breakdown:
     1. Move straight down for a certain distance.
     2. Curve to the left to complete the semi-circle.

2.1 **Simple Trajectory Breakdown:**
   - "Start at (0, 0), move down to (0, -2) (straight part of 'J'), then curve left from (0, -2) to (-1, -3), closing the 'J'."

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** 
   - The downward movement will go from (0, 0) to (0, -2).
   - The curve will be represented parametrically where it starts at (0, -2) and smoothly arcs to (-1, -3).

4. **Mathematical Functions:**
```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    if t < 0.5:  # First half: straight down
        x = 0
        y = -4 * t  # From 0 to -2
    else:  # Second half: curve
        t_curve = 2 * (t - 0.5)  # Normalize t for the curve part
        x = -t_curve + 0  # Creating a leftward curve
        y = -2 - np.sqrt(1 - (t_curve - 1)**2)  # Bottom part of the 'J'

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 1)
``` 

This code smoothly transitions between the straight and curved sections of the 'J', capturing the desired trajectory as specified.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Perform a U-turn.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: 1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory described by "Perform a U-turn." is open because it describes a directional change rather than a complete loop or figure.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
   - Start facing forward (12 o'clock).
   - Walk forward for a certain distance (let's say 10 meters).
   - Turn 180 degrees to face the opposite direction.
   - Walk back the same distance (10 meters).

   The breakdown can be summarized as:
   - Walk forward for 10 meters.
   - Turn 180 degrees.
   - Walk backward for 10 meters.

2.1 **Movement Breakdown:**
   - **Segment 1:** 
     - Start position: (0, 0)
     - Move forward (0, 10)
   - **Segment 2:** 
     - Turn around 180 degrees ---
     - Starting back at (0, 10)
     - Move back to (0, 0)

3. **Trajectory Analysis:**
   - The first segment will go from (0, 0) to (0, 10) as the person walks forward 10 meters. 
   - The second segment goes back from (0, 10) to (0, 0) as the person walks backward.
   - The trajectory can be described using a time parameter `t` to ensure continuity and uniform motion.

4. **Mathematical Functions:**
```python
def shape_curve(t):
    # Segment 1: Move forward for 10 meters
    if t < 5:  # for t in [0, 5)
        x = 0
        y = 2 * t  # Since t=5 corresponds to y=10
    # Segment 2: Move backward for 10 meters

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'U-shaped:a man walk in the trjectory of a U-turn'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: 1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The described trajectory is closed since it forms a U-shape that connects back to its starting point.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
   - "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 180 degrees left, and walk backward for 5 meters."

3. **Trajectory Analysis:**
   - Starting Point (0, 0), moving forward 5 meters to (5, 0).
   - Turning 180 degrees left would take the man's trajectory back along the same path to the starting point (0, 0). This U-shaped movement can be represented mathematically.

4. **Mathematical Functions:**
```python
def shape_curve(t):
    if t < 0.5:  # First half of the U-shape
        x = 5 * t  # Moving forward from (0, 0) to (5, 0)
        y = 0
    else:  # Second half of the U-shape
        x = 5 * (1 - t)  # Moving back from (5, 0) to (0, 5)

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 1)
```
- The range `t` goes from 0 to 1, where `t = 0` starts at point (0, 0), `t = 0.5` is at (5, 0), and `t = 1` finishes at (0, 5). This ensures a smooth transition along the U-shaped trajectory.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'U-shaped:a man walk in the trjectory of a U-turn'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: 1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory is closed because a "U-shaped" path returns to its starting point, forming a loop.

   - Move back to the starting point A (0, 0) in a curved manner.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:**
   - The trajectory can be broken into three segments: 
     1. Segment from A to B (straight right).
     2. Segment from B to C (upward curve).
     3. Segment from C to A (downward curve).

This code provides a continuous trajectory for a person walking in a U-shaped path. The function uses three segments with smooth transitions to ensure that the walk is represented correctly in a mathematical form.

**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.
再次强调：为了确保平滑过渡，您需要调整每一段段的公式，使其从上一段的终点坐标开始，而不是独立地重新定义 x 和 y。如果有不同的t段落，每一段的开始坐标和结束坐标应该在注释中标注出来！start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y

4. **Mathematical Functions:** Present the final code strictly in the form provided below, ensuring it is correct and can run without errors and READY TO USE.

**Code Format:**
```python
def shape_curve(t):xz
    ...

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (start_value, end_value)
```

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'U-shaped:a man walk in the trjectory of a U-turn'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: 1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory is closed since a "U-shaped" trajectory represents a complete loop back to the starting point.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:** 
   - Start at point (0, 0).
   - Walk forward along a curve to form the left side of the 'U' (moving leftward and upwards).
   - Reach the top of the 'U' and then turn and walk downwards to complete the right side of the 'U'.

2.1 Simple breakdown of movement:
- Walk forward for 5 meters in a curve to the left while going vertically upward.
- Walk forward for 5 meters down in a curve to the right returning back to the starting vertical level.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** 
   The U-shaped trajectory can be represented by a parametric equation that defines a curve from the starting point, moves upward to the top of the 'U', and then returns downward back to the original vertical level. The transition from upward to downward must be smooth.

4. **Mathematical Functions:**

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    if t < 5:
        # First part: left side of U (0 to 5)
        # start_x = 0, start_y = 0, end_x = -5, end_y = 5
        x = -5 + t  # Moves from 0 to -5
        y = t  # Moves up from 0 to 5
    else:
        # Second part: right side of U (5 to 10)
        # start_x = -5, start_y = 5, end_x = 0, end_y = 0
        x = -5 + (10 - t)  # Moves from -5 at t=5 to 0 at t=10
        y = 5 - (10 - t)  # Moves down from 5 back to 0

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 10)
