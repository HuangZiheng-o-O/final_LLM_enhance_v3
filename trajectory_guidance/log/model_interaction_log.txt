User:
**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open. So, avoid using a closed trajectory for an open path like S, a common error is to make it like shape 8.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'S-shaped:a man walk in the trjectory of a S-shape'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To tackle the provided task, we need to focus on defining an "S-shape" trajectory. Since an "S-shape" is an open curve, we should design the trajectory to reflect that. The curve will smoothly transition from one segment to the next, maintaining consistent motion.

### Trajectory Decision

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:**
   The trajectory for an "S-shape" is **open**.

### Trajectory Analysis

For an "S-shaped" curve, imagine tracing an S from top to bottom. This entails moving in a smooth wave-like fashion.

### Mathematical Functions

To mathematically describe this, we can use parametric equations involving sine functions, which naturally create wave shapes. To form an "S", we need two connected wave segments facing opposite directions.

Here is the breakdown and the code implementing this:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # The "S" shape can be approximated by combining two half-period sine waves offset horizontally.
    # First half-wave
    if 0 <= t < 0.5:
        x = t
        y = np.sin(2 * np.pi * t + np.pi)  # Starts at top and goes downwards
    # Second half-wave
    elif 0.5 <= t <= 1:
        t_adjusted = t - 0.5
        x = 0.5 + t_adjusted
        y = -np.sin(2 * np.pi * t_adjusted + np.pi)  # Goes upwards

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t to be from 0 to 1.
t_range = (0, 1)
```

### Explanation

- **First Half-Wave:**
  - `0 <= t < 0.5`: It transitions the curve from top to bottom.
  - `x = t`: Moves in the positive x-direction linearly.
  - `y = np.sin(2 * np.pi * t + np.pi)`: Produces a downward sine wave for the first half.

- **Second Half-Wave:**
  - `0.5 <= t <= 1`: Comes after the first half.
  - `x = 0.5 + t_adjusted`: Continues the x-direction after the half point.
  - `y = -np.sin(2 * np.pi * t_adjusted + np.pi)`: Produces an upward sine wave for the second half.

This creates a smooth, continuous "S" trajectory that transitions naturally without abrupt changes, as requested.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Walk forward, and turn (towards 10 o'clock) and continue walking , then turn (towards 10 o'clock) and continue walking .'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To create a trajectory for the given description, we need to break down the path into segments and analyze the movement at each step. The description suggests an open trajectory with a series of straight lines and consecutive turns towards the 10 o'clock direction.

Let's break it down:

### Trajectory Breakdown:
1. **First Segment:**
   - Walk forward. This implies a straight line heading directly ahead.
   - We assume a moderate distance for simplicity (e.g., 5 units).

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Turn towards the 10 o'clock direction (which is slightly to the left), and continue walking.
   - Continue for a similar distance.

3. **Third Segment:**
   - Again, turn slightly towards the 10 o'clock direction, and continue walking straight.

### Trajectory Analysis:
This describes an open trajectory that consists of straight lines with gentle left curves between them.

### Continuous and Smooth Trajectory:
- Ensure each segment starts where the last left off.
- Maintain uniform speed across the trajectory ensuring no instant jumps.

### Mathematical Path Specification:
We'll employ simple piecewise linear functions to represent each segment.

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    if 0 <= t < 1:
        # First segment: Walk forward
        x = 5 * t
        y = 0
    elif 1 <= t < 2:
        # Transition: Turn towards 10 o'clock (slightly left)
        # Second segment: Continue walking in new direction
        start_x, start_y = shape_curve(1) # Integration point
        x = start_x + (4 * (t - 1))
        y = start_y + (1 * (t - 1))
    elif 2 <= t <= 3:
        # Transition: Again turn towards 10 o'clock
        # Third segment: Continue walking in new direction
        start_x, start_y = shape_curve(2) # Integration point
        x = start_x + (3 * (t - 2))
        y = start_y + (2 * (t - 2))
    else:
        raise ValueError("t is out of the expected range")

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 3)
```

### Explanation:
- **Segment 1**: Moves straight along the x-axis from `(0, 0)` to `(5, 0)`.
- **Segment 2**: Starts at `(5, 0)`, turns slightly left, and moves roughly in a direction of `(4, 1)` units until `(9, 1)`.
- **Segment 3**: Starts at `(9, 1)`, turns again slightly left, and moves roughly `(3, 2)` units until `(12, 3)`.

This code reflects the described trajectory, maintaining uniform speed and smooth transitions between the segments.

"I want to draw a Description = 'Walk forward, and turn right and continue walking , and turn right and continue walking .'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: Based on the description provided, you want to represent a path that involves walking forward, turning right, and continuing to walk twice. This description suggests a relatively simple open trajectory that roughly forms a "U" shape, starting off in one direction, making two right-angle turns to continue walking in the final direction.

**Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:**
- This trajectory is open because the description does not imply returning to the starting point. It involves segments of walking with two right-angle turns.

**Trajectory Analysis:**
1. Walk forward.
2. Turn right and continue walking.
3. Turn right again and continue walking.

Let's define each segment:
1. Walk straight ahead for some distance.
2. Make a right turn (90 degrees) and continue walking forward for an equal distance.
3. Make another right turn (90 degrees) and walk forward for an equal distance.

**Mathematical Function:**

```python

        # Segment 1: Walk forward
        start_x, start_y = 0, 0   # Starting point

        x = start_x
        y = start_y + 5 * t
    elif 1 <= t < 2:
        # Segment 2: Turn right and continue walking
        start_x, start_y = 0, 5   # Start of second segment
        end_x, end_y = 5, 5       # End of second segment
        x = start_x + 5 * (t - 1)
        y = start_y

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Trapezoid: using a trajectory that forms a trapezoid with one pair of parallel sides.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: Given the description of a trapezoid with one pair of parallel sides, we'll define a closed trajectory that moves in the shape of a trapezoid. For simplicity, assume an isosceles trapezoid, where the non-parallel sides are of equal length.

### Closed Trajectory Decision:
The trapezoid shape is a closed trajectory because it returns to its starting point to form a complete figure.

### Trajectory Analysis:
To accurately describe this shape as a trajectory, we can break it down into four segments:
1. Starting from the bottom left corner, move right to form the bottom parallel side.
2. Move diagonally left and upward to form one of the non-parallel sides.
3. Move right again to form the top parallel side.
4. Finally, move diagonally downward to return to the starting point and complete the trapezoid.

Let's define this in mathematical terms, ensuring smooth transitions between each segment.

### Mathematical Functions:
```python
def shape_curve(t):
    # Define each segment of the trapezoid with smooth transitions
    if 0 <= t < 0.25:
        # Segment 1: Bottom side, moving right
        start_x, start_y = 0, 0
        end_x, end_y = 1, 0
        x = start_x + (end_x - start_x) * (t / 0.25)
        y = start_y
    
    elif 0.25 <= t < 0.5:
        # Segment 2: Left non-parallel side, moving diagonally
        start_x, start_y = 1, 0
        end_x, end_y = 0.7, 0.5
        x = start_x + (end_x - start_x) * ((t - 0.25) / 0.25)
        y = start_y + (end_y - start_y) * ((t - 0.25) / 0.25)
    
    elif 0.5 <= t < 0.75:
        # Segment 3: Top side, moving right
        start_x, start_y = 0.7, 0.5
        end_x, end_y = 0.3, 0.5
        x = start_x + (end_x - start_x) * ((t - 0.5) / 0.25)
        y = start_y
    
    else:
        # Segment 4: Right non-parallel side, moving downward to starting point
        start_x, start_y = 0.3, 0.5
        end_x, end_y = 0, 0
        x = start_x + (end_x - start_x) * ((t - 0.75) / 0.25)

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)

```

**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open. So, avoid using a closed trajectory for an open path like S, a common error is to make it like shape 8.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.
再次强调：为了确保平滑过渡，您需要调整每一段段的公式，使其从上一段的终点坐标开始，而不是独立地重新定义 x 和 y。如果有不同的t段落，每一段的开始坐标和结束坐标应该在注释中标注出来！start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y

"I want to draw a Description = 'Spiral: using a trajectory that starts at the center and spirals outward.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To accurately represent the trajectory described as a "Spiral: using a trajectory that starts at the center and spirals outward", the curve should be designed to increase in radius as it progresses, creating an outward spiraling effect. This can be effectively modeled using a parametric equation for a spiral.

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:**  
   The trajectory for a spiral as described is open, as it continuously moves outward and does not loop back on itself.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**  
   For a spiral, the movement can be envisioned as:
   - Starting at a center point `(0, 0)`.
   - Gradually move outward in a circular path, increasing the distance from the center as you rotate.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:**  
   To form a spiral, we can use polar coordinates `(r, θ)`, where `r` (radius) increases with `θ` (angle). When converted to Cartesian coordinates `(x, y)`, the equations can be expressed using trigonometric functions. The radius `r` can be a linear function of `θ` to ensure the spiral moves outward uniformly.

Given this, we can define the spiral using the equations:
- \( r(t) = a + b \cdot t \), where `a` is the initial radius (set to 0) and `b` controls the rate of spiral expansion.
- \( x(t) = r(t) \cdot \cos(t) \)
- \( y(t) = r(t) \cdot \sin(t) \)

Let's present the trajectory with these considerations:

```python
import math

def shape_curve(t):
    # Parameters to control the spiral form
    a = 0  # Initial radius
    b = 0.1  # Spiral growth rate

    # Calculating the polar coordinates
    r = a + b * t

    # Converting polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates
    x = r * math.cos(t)
    y = r * math.sin(t)

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 20 * math.pi)  # Covers multiple turns in the spiral
```

This code will produce a spiral that starts at the origin `(0, 0)` and spirals outward as `t` increases. The range for `t` is set to encompass multiple turns of the spiral, providing a full representation of the described trajectory.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Heart: using a trajectory that forms the shape of a heart.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To create a trajectory that forms the shape of a heart, we need a trajectory that outlines the iconic curves and point of a heart. The heart shape can be broken down into two symmetric circular arcs at the top and a pointed end at the bottom.

Given that the heart shape is symmetric and closed, we ensure the trajectory smoothly follows this pattern. Let's start by defining the trajectory:

### Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:
The heart shape is a closed trajectory.

### Trajectory Analysis:
A heart shape consists of two symmetrical arcs at the top and a point at the bottom. We can mathematically approximate this using parametric equations for a heart shape.

### Mathematical Functions:
Let's implement a function for drawing a heart shape trajectory:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Heart shape parametric equations
    x = 16 * np.sin(t) ** 3
    y = 13 * np.cos(t) - 5 * np.cos(2 * t) - 2 * np.cos(3 * t) - np.cos(4 * t)
    
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 2 * np.pi)
```

### Explanation:
- The parametric equations for `x` and `y` are chosen to represent the heart shape. These equations generate the characteristic curves and pointed bottom of a heart.
- `t` ranges from `0` to `2π`, allowing a full cycle of the heart shape to be created smoothly and continuously.

This code is ready to plot a heart-shaped trajectory when fed into a function that evaluates it over the specified `t_range`.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Wave: using a trajectory that follows a wavy pattern.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: For this task, we need to create an open trajectory that follows a wavy pattern. The wave is a simple curve, so the trajectory can be directly defined using a sinusoidal function. Here's how you can represent this waveform in a mathematical function:

### Trajectory Analysis:

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Since a wave does not form a closed loop and just moves forward in a sinusoidal pattern, it is an open trajectory.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:** 
   - The wavy pattern can be represented as a sine wave. Hence, the trajectory will move horizontally while oscillating vertically.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** 
   - The sine wave is the ideal representation of this pattern because it naturally alternates up and down.
   - To maintain the uniform movement and speed, we'll adjust the parameters so that each oscillation is smooth and continuous.

### Final Mathematical Function:

The sine wave can be expressed with:
- `x(t) = t` (representing horizontal uniform movement over time)
- `y(t) = A * sin(B * t)` where `A` is the amplitude (height of the wave peaks) and `B` is the frequency (how many wave cycles happen in a unit of `t`).

```python
import math

def shape_curve(t):
    A = 5  # Amplitude of the wave
    B = 1  # Frequency of the wave

    x = t
    y = A * math.sin(B * t)

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t according to how long you wish the wave to extend. 
# For example, you can set the range to cover one full wave cycle or more.
t_range = (0, 10 * math.pi)  # This will cover 5 full wave cycles
```

### Explanation:
- **Amplitude (A)** is set to 5 units, meaning the wave oscillates 5 units above and below the central line (y = 0).
- **Frequency (B)** is set to 1, determining how many complete waves appear within the defined `t_range`.
- **Range of t** is chosen to cover several cycles of the wave, starting from 0 and ending at `10 * π`, giving us 5 full cycles given our frequency setup. Adjust this range depending on how long you want your wave to be.

This continuous function ensures even mapping of the wave trajectory over time (t), with no abrupt jumps or discontinuities.
extracted_code: import math

def shape_curve(t):
    A = 5  # Amplitude of the wave
    B = 1  # Frequency of the wave

"I want to draw a Description = 'Circle: using a trajectory that forms a complete circle.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To draw a trajectory that forms a complete circle, let's analyze the requirements:

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory is closed since a circle is a geometric figure that loops back to its starting point.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:** The description is straightforward as it defines a complete circle, so detailed breakdown is not needed.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** To ensure uniform speed and smoothness, we'll use trigonometric functions to represent the trajectory of the circle. The circle will have a radius `r`, and `t` will represent the angle in radians from 0 to \(2\pi\), which corresponds to the complete circle.

Here’s the trajectory code:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Radius of the circle
    r = 1  # You can adjust the radius as needed

    # Parametric equations for the circle

    y = r * np.sin(t)

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t to draw a complete circle
t_range = (0, 2 * np.pi)
```

### Explanation:
- The circle is defined using parametric equations with angle `t`:
  - \( x(t) = r \cdot \cos(t) \)
  - \( y(t) = r \cdot \sin(t) \)
- `t_range` is set from 0 to \(2\pi\) to complete the circle.

Model: To create a trajectory that forms an equilateral triangle, you need a closed path. This means the start and end points of the trajectory coincide.

### Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:
- **Closed Trajectory**: An equilateral triangle is a geometric figure with equal sides and angle, therefore the trajectory is closed.

### Mathematical Functions:
We will break down the trajectory into three equal segments, each representing one side of the triangle. Assume the triangle is centered at the origin for simplicity.

The general approach is to form the trajectory as a function of `t` which rotates around 60 degrees per segment (since there are three equal angles of 60 degrees in an equilateral triangle).

### Mathematical Representation:
1. Define the center of the triangle at the origin.
2. The side length of the triangle will determine the amplitude of the movement.
3. Define three segments for each side of the triangle.

### Analysis:
- Ensure the trajectory transitions smoothly between segments.
- Use parametric equations to represent linear segments.

Here is the code that represents the trajectory in the form of an equilateral triangle centered at the origin:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Side length of the equilateral triangle
    side_length = 1
    # Height of the equilateral triangle
    height = (np.sqrt(3) / 2) * side_length

    # Determine which segment the current `t` is in (assuming t is normalized between 0 and 3)
    segment_duration = 1  # Each segment takes 1 time unit

    if 0 <= t < segment_duration:
        # Movement along the first side
        t_segment = t / segment_duration
        start_x, start_y = -side_length / 2, -height / 3
        end_x, end_y = side_length / 2, -height / 3
        x = (1 - t_segment) * start_x + t_segment * end_x
        y = (1 - t_segment) * start_y + t_segment * end_y
    elif segment_duration <= t < 2 * segment_duration:
        # Movement along the second side
        t_segment = (t - segment_duration) / segment_duration
        start_x, start_y = side_length / 2, -height / 3
        end_x, end_y = 0, 2 * height / 3
        x = (1 - t_segment) * start_x + t_segment * end_x
        y = (1 - t_segment) * start_y + t_segment * end_y
    elif 2 * segment_duration <= t <= 3 * segment_duration:
        # Movement along the third side
        t_segment = (t - 2 * segment_duration) / segment_duration
        start_x, start_y = 0, 2 * height / 3
        end_x, end_y = -side_length / 2, -height / 3
        x = (1 - t_segment) * start_x + t_segment * end_x
        y = (1 - t_segment) * start_y + t_segment * end_y
    
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 3)
```

### Explanation:
- The triangle is centered at the origin.
- Each segment of `t` corresponds to one side of the triangle.
- The parameter `t` ranges from 0 to 3, with each unit of `t` representing movement along one side of the triangle.
- Transitions between segments are smooth by using linear interpolation to ensure continuous motion.

**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open. So, avoid using a closed trajectory for an open path like S, a common error is to make it like shape 8.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.
再次强调：为了确保平滑过渡，您需要调整每一段段的公式，使其从上一段的终点坐标开始，而不是独立地重新定义 x 和 y。如果有不同的t段落，每一段的开始坐标和结束坐标应该在注释中标注出来！start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Pentagon: using a trajectory that forms a regular pentagon.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To draw a trajectory that forms a regular pentagon, we need to create a closed trajectory that outlines the shape of a pentagon.

### Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:
The trajectory for a regular pentagon is **closed** because it is a geometric figure that forms a closed path by connecting the start and end points.

### Extract the Trajectory:
For a regular pentagon, we can break down the trajectory into five equal linear segments with equal internal angles between them. Each side will involve moving in a straight line and then turning to form the next angle.

### Trajectory Analysis:
To ensure the trajectory is smooth and consistent, we need to calculate the movement along the pentagon's edges and ensure it's uniform across each segment. The internal angle of a regular pentagon is \(108\) degrees. We calculate the trajectory points based on these turns.

### Mathematical Functions:
For simplicity and to ensure uniform transition, we can calculate the movement using parametric equations for the pentagon's shape. Let's assume a circumscribed radius \(r\) of 1 for simplicity. We will distribute the `t` parameter such that it completes the pentagon while ensuring uniform speed and continuity between segments.

Here's the code that describes the pentagon shape using a trajectory function:

```python
import math

def shape_curve(t):
    # ensure that radians are used for angular divisions
    angle = math.radians(360 / 5)  # divide full circle (360 degrees) by 5 for pentagon
    r = 1  # assume a unit circumradius for simplicity

    # Calculate x, y based on parametric equations
    segment = int(t * 5)  # We divide the range of t into 5 segments (0 to 4)
    segment_t = t * 5 - segment  # Normalize t for each segment between 0 and 1

    # Calculate positions for the 5 vertices of the pentagon
    start_x = r * math.cos(segment * angle)
    start_y = r * math.sin(segment * angle)
    end_x = r * math.cos((segment + 1) * angle)
    end_y = r * math.sin((segment + 1) * angle)

    # Interpolate between start and end point based on segment_t
    x = (1 - segment_t) * start_x + segment_t * end_x
    y = (1 - segment_t) * start_y + segment_t * end_y

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (evenly divided for 5 segments)
t_range = (0, 1)
```

- **Explanation:**
  - We divide the trajectory into 5 equal segments, each corresponding to an edge of the pentagon.
  - The `t` parameter ranges from 0 to 1, and each segment internally subdivides it further into 5 equally, applying it to one side at a time.
  - Each vertex position is calculated based on the angle subtended at the center, and transitions between vertices are linear to maintain uniform speed.
  - The `shape_curve(t)` function ensures the trajectory forms a smooth and closed pentagon path.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Infinity: using a trajectory that forms the shape of an infinity symbol.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To draw a trajectory forming the shape of an infinity symbol, we're dealing with a closed trajectory, as it loops back on itself continuously.

The mathematical equation for an infinity symbol (often referred to as a "lemniscate") can be represented using parametric equations. A common mathematical representation is:

\[ x(t) = A \cdot \cos(t) \]
\[ y(t) = B \cdot \sin(2t) \]

Where \( A \) and \( B \) are constants that can be adjusted to change the dimensions of the lemniscate. For a balanced infinity symbol, we'll often set \( A \) and \( B \) to the same value.

Here's how to implement it in a Python function:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Constants defining the size of the lemniscate
    A = 1  # Width scale factor
    B = 1  # Height scale factor
    
    # Parametric equations for the lemniscate (infinity symbol)
    x = A * np.cos(t)
    y = B * np.sin(2 * t)
    
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t to complete the shape
t_range = (0, 2 * np.pi)
```

This code will produce a continuous, smooth trajectory resembling an infinity symbol over the range \( t = 0 \) to \( t = 2\pi \). Adjust the constants \( A \) and \( B \) if you want to change the aspect ratio of the infinity symbol.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Crescent: using a trajectory that forms the shape of a crescent moon.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To create a crescent shape, we'll need to draw two arcs: an outer arc and an inner arc, with the inner arc overlapping and partially obscuring the outer arc to form the crescent moon shape.

Here's how this can be broken down and implemented:

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory is closed because a crescent is a closed shape formed by two overlapping arcs.

2. **Trajectory Analysis:** We'll create two arcs:
   - The outer arc is a large semicircle.
   - The inner arc is a smaller semicircle that will overlap the outer arc to form the crescent shape.

3. **Mathematical Functions:** We'll use parametric equations for circles and semicircles to create these arcs. The idea is to subtract one semicircle (the smaller inner arc) from another (the larger outer arc) to form the crescent.

Here's the code to generate a crescent moon shape:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    if t < 0.5:
        # Outer arc (semi-circle)
        theta_outer = np.pi * t * 2  # Scaled to full circle
        x_outer = np.cos(theta_outer)
        y_outer = np.sin(theta_outer)
        return 2 * x_outer, 2 * y_outer
    else:
        # Inner arc (smaller semi-circle) shifted to overlap
        theta_inner = np.pi * (t - 0.5) * 2  # Scaled to full circle
        x_inner = np.cos(theta_inner)
        y_inner = np.sin(theta_inner)
        return 2 * (x_inner - 0.5), 2 * y_inner

# Specify the range of t.
t_range = (0, 1)
```

**Explanation:**
- We have divided `t` into two segments:
  - **Outer Arc (0 ≤ t < 0.5):** Forms the larger semicircle part of the crescent.
  - **Inner Arc (0.5 ≤ t ≤ 1):** Forms the smaller semicircle which overlaps the larger one, creating the crescent effect.
- Each arc starts at the previous one's end point to ensure continuity and smooth transitions.
- The `2` multiplier in coordinates ensures both arcs are about the same scale for good overlap, and the `0.5` shift ensures placement to mimic a typical crescent shape.

This code generates the trajectory for a crescent moon in a simple, smooth manner.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Lightning: using a trajectory that forms the shape of a lightning bolt.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To create a trajectory that forms the shape of a lightning bolt, one way to approach this is by using segments that mimic the typical zigzag pattern of lightning. This pattern generally consists of sharp angles and abrupt direction changes. Below, I'll provide a Python function that generates such a trajectory.

### Trajectory Decision:
The trajectory is **open**, as it represents a lightning bolt, which typically starts at a point and ends at another without looping back.

### Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:
1. Start at a point, move diagonally downwards to the right.
2. Turn sharply to the left and move diagonally upwards.
3. Turn sharply to the right and move horizontally.
4. Turn downwards to finish the bolt shape.

### Trajectory Analysis:
We'll break the bolt into three segments for simplicity. Assume `t` ranges from 0 to 1, changing uniformly over time.

### Mathematical Functions:
In the provided Python function, we've divided the lightning bolt into three linear segments. Each segment represents a different part of the lightning bolt.

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    if t < 0.33:  # First segment
        # Start: (0, 0), End: (1, -1)
        start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y = 0, 0, 1, -1
        x = start_x + (end_x - start_x) * (t / 0.33)
        y = start_y + (end_y - start_y) * (t / 0.33)
    elif t < 0.66:  # Second segment
        # Start: (1, -1), End: (0, 1)
        start_x, start_y = 1, -1
        end_x, end_y = 0, 1
        x = start_x + (end_x - start_x) * ((t - 0.33) / 0.33)
        y = start_y + (end_y - start_y) * ((t - 0.33) / 0.33)
    else:  # Third segment
        # Start: (0, 1), End: (2, 0.5)
        start_x, start_y = 0, 1
        end_x, end_y = 2, 0.5
        x = start_x + (end_x - start_x) * ((t - 0.66) / 0.34)
        y = start_y + (end_y - start_y) * ((t - 0.66) / 0.34)
        
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 1)
```

### Explanation:
- The trajectory uses three segments to mimic the zigzag pattern of a typical lightning bolt.
- The function smoothly transitions between each segment by using linear interpolation.
- For uniform movement, each segment receives a proportional section of `t`.
- Start and end coordinates are specified for each segment to ensure continuity.

        y = start_y + (end_y - start_y) * (t / 0.33)

**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open. So, avoid using a closed trajectory for an open path like S, a common error is to make it like shape 8.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.
再次强调：为了确保平滑过渡，您需要调整每一段段的公式，使其从上一段的终点坐标开始，而不是独立地重新定义 x 和 y。如果有不同的t段落，每一段的开始坐标和结束坐标应该在注释中标注出来！start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y

"I want to draw a Description = 'SnakeTrajectory: using a continuous trajectory that resembles a snake.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To represent a snake-like trajectory using a continuous curve, we'll create a smooth, wavy path typical of a snake's movement. This path will be open, as snakes generally move forward rather than in closed loops.

### Trajectory Analysis:
Given the nature of a snake's movement, we can achieve this effect using a sinusoidal wave, which inherently resembles the undulating motion of a snake. As the snake advances horizontally, it moves in a sine-wave pattern vertically.

### Mathematical Functions:
We'll use the sine function to create the vertical oscillation while maintaining forward motion in the horizontal direction. For simplicity and to ensure a uniform speed, the x-coordinate will advance linearly, and the y-coordinate will oscillate.

Here is the code to generate this snake-like trajectory:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Use a simple sinusoidal wave to emulate a snake-like trajectory
    # x increases linearly while y oscillates in a sine wave pattern
    x = t
    y = 5 * np.sin(t * 2 * np.pi / 10)  # Amplitude of 5 units, one cycle every 10 units
    
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t for an open trajectory
t_range = (0, 20)
```

### Explanation:
- **x = t**: The x-coordinate increases linearly, which moves the trajectory forward over time.
- **y = 5 * np.sin(t * 2 * np.pi / 10)**: The y-coordinate varies sinusoidally, creating a wave with an amplitude of 5 and a period corresponding to 10 units of t. This simulates the side-to-side slithering motion of a snake.
- **t_range = (0, 20)**: This interval generates a segment of the path, where t represents time or a similar parameter, defining the snake's forward motion and its oscillation pattern.

This code generates a smooth and continuous snake-like trajectory without abrupt changes, ensuring an open path aligned to the described motion.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Spiral: using a trajectory that forms a spiral starting from the center and moving outward.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To implement a spiral trajectory starting from the center and moving outward, we will use a polar coordinate system where the radius gradually increases as the angle increases. This can be achieved using the following parametric equations for a spiral:

- \(x(t) = (a + b \cdot t) \cdot \cos(t)\)
- \(y(t) = (a + b \cdot t) \cdot \sin(t)\)

where:
- \(a\) is the initial radius.
- \(b\) controls the increase in radius per unit angle.

The trajectory is open since a spiral typically does not loop back on itself unless specified explicitly. We'll ensure the trajectory is smooth by uniformly changing both x and y over time.

Let's implement this in `shape_curve(t)`:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Constants defining the spiral
    a = 0  # Initial radius
    b = 0.1  # Rate of spiral expansion
    
    x = (a + b * t) * np.cos(t)
    y = (a + b * t) * np.sin(t)

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (starting small can show the spiral better)
t_range = (0, 10 * np.pi)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Trajectory is Open:** A spiral trajectory is open as it starts from the center and moves outwards indefinitely.
2. **Equation Breakdown:**
   - We start with an initial radius \(a\).
   - The radius increases linearly with time, controlled by parameter \(b\), as \(b \cdot t\).
3. **Uniform Change Over Time:** The x and y coordinates change uniformly as \(t\) increases, ensuring smooth transitions through consistent growth of both coordinates.
4. **Range of \(t\):** We define a range for \(t\) from 0 to \(10\pi\) to produce a noticeable spiral pattern. This can be adjusted according to the desired length of the spiral.

def shape_curve(t):

"I want to draw a Description = 'Semicircle: using a trajectory that forms a half-circle.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To address the description given, we need to create a trajectory that forms a semicircle. This trajectory will be an open curve since a semicircle is not a closed figure. Here's how we can express this mathematically and in code:

**Trajectory Analysis:**

1. **Open Trajectory Decision:** Since the description asks for a semicircle, the trajectory is open.

2. **Trajectory Specification:** A semicircle can be represented by a segment of a circle. For simplicity, let’s consider a semicircle in the x-y plane, centered at the origin, and extending horizontally from -R to R. We'll choose the upper half of the circle.

3. We can use parametric equations to represent the semicircle trajectory:
   - \( x(t) = R \cdot \cos(t) \)
   - \( y(t) = R \cdot \sin(t) \)
   - Where \( t \) ranges from 0 to \( \pi \) to cover the semicircle.

4. We assume a uniform speed in tracing this semicircle, which means the parameter \( t \) will change linearly between the start and end values.

Here's the specific code to create a semicircle trajectory:

```python
import math

def shape_curve(t):
    R = 1  # Radius of the semicircle, adjust as needed
    x = R * math.cos(t)
    y = R * math.sin(t)
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t to cover the semicircle (from 0 to π radians)
t_range = (0, math.pi)
```

This code snippet will generate the (x, y) coordinates for a semicircle with a radius of 1. The parameter \( t \) will range from 0 to \( \pi \), which covers the upper half of the circle, thus forming a semicircle.

"I want to draw a Description = 'Arrow: using a trajectory that forms an arrow shape with a straight line and a triangular head.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To draw the trajectory of an arrow shape, we need to represent it with a straight line for the shaft and a triangular head. This is an open trajectory since it does not loop back to the start.

### Trajectory Analysis:
1. **Straight Line (Shaft):** This will be a horizontal line.
2. **Triangular Head:** This will involve two angled lines coming out from the end of the shaft forming a triangle shape with the base of the triangle aligned with the continuation of the shaft.

### Trajectory Breakdown:
- Start from `(0, 0)`, move right to `(1, 0)` for the shaft.
- Turn upwards to form a diagonal reaching up to the tip of the triangle at `(1.5, 0.5)`.
- Connect diagonally back down to `(2, 0)` to complete the head of the arrow.

### Ensuring Continuity:
- Segment 1: Horizontal line for the shaft.
- Segment 2: Diagonal from end of the shaft to the upper tip of the triangle.
- Segment 3: Diagonal back to complete the triangle.

Let's define this mathematically with continuity and uniform changes:

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    if 0 <= t < 1:
        # Shaft: Horizontal line (0 <= t < 1)
        x = t
        y = 0
    elif 1 <= t < 1.5:
        # Triangle head - diagonal upward line (1 <= t < 1.5)
        start_x, start_y = 1, 0  # Starting at end of shaft
        end_x, end_y = 1.5, 0.5  # Tip of the arrow
        x = start_x + (end_x - start_x) * (t - 1)
        y = start_y + (end_y - start_y) * (t - 1)
    elif 1.5 <= t <= 2:
        # Triangle head - diagonal downward line (1.5 <= t <= 2)
        start_x, start_y = 1.5, 0.5  # Starting at tip of arrow
        end_x, end_y = 2, 0  # Completion at base of arrowhead
        x = start_x + (end_x - start_x) * (t - 1.5)
        y = start_y + (end_y - start_y) * (t - 1.5)
    else:
        # Outside defined range
        x, y = None, None

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
t_range = (0, 2)
```

This code will input `t` in the range `(0, 2)` to draw a simple arrow shape with a straight line and a triangular head. Each segment connects smoothly without abrupt transitions.

**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open. So, avoid using a closed trajectory for an open path like S, a common error is to make it like shape 8.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:

1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.

"I want to draw a Description = 'Ellipse: using a trajectory that forms an elongated circle, or oval shape.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: Certainly! The description indicates that we want to draw an ellipse, which is a closed trajectory since an ellipse is a continuous loop without an endpoint.

We'll create the mathematical representation for an ellipse trajectory using parametric equations. An ellipse centered at the origin with a semi-major axis \( a \) and a semi-minor axis \( b \) can be represented as:
\[ x = a \cdot \cos(t) \]
\[ y = b \cdot \sin(t) \]

For a smooth and continuous ellipse, the parameter \( t \) represents the angle in radians, typically ranging from 0 to \( 2\pi \).

Here's the corresponding Python code:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Parameters for the ellipse
    a = 5  # semi-major axis length
    b = 3  # semi-minor axis length
    
    # Parametric equations for the ellipse
    x = a * np.cos(t)
    y = b * np.sin(t)
    
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (full ellipse cycle)
t_range = (0, 2 * np.pi)
```

This code snippet defines a function `shape_curve(t)` that returns the x and y coordinates of a point on the ellipse based on the parameter \( t \). The semi-major axis \( a \) is set to 5 units, and the semi-minor axis \( b \) is set to 3 units, forming an elongated circle—a classic ellipse. The function is ready to be used over the specified range of \( t \).

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Square: using a square trajectory with a return to the origin.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To create the trajectory for a square with a return to the origin, it's important to ensure that the trajectory is closed, as it forms a complete geometric shape. We'll break down the path into four straight segments representing the sides of the square and return to the starting point, ensuring smooth transitions between each segment.

### Closed Trajectory Decision:
Since the description specifies a square and mentions a return to the origin, it indicates a closed trajectory.

### Trajectory Extraction (Detailed Breakdown):
1. Start at the origin (0, 0).
2. Move right along the x-axis.
3. Move up parallel to the y-axis.
4. Move left along the x-axis.
5. Move down back to the starting point (0, 0).

### Trajectory Analysis:
Each side of the square will have a constant length, and the transitions will ensure that the path forms a continuous loop (no jumps). Assume the square's side is of unit length for simplicity.

### Mathematical Functions Code:
Here's the Python function to describe this trajectory. We'll assign different segments of time to each movement to ensure smooth transitions and consistent speed, marking the starting and ending points of each segment.

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    # A unit square trajectory
    side_length = 1
    
    if 0 <= t < 1:
        # Move from (0, 0) to (1, 0)
        start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y = 0, 0, side_length, 0
        x = start_x + (end_x - start_x) * t
        y = start_y
        
    elif 1 <= t < 2:
        # Move from (1, 0) to (1, 1)
        start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y = side_length, 0, side_length, side_length
        x = start_x
        y = start_y + (end_y - start_y) * (t - 1)
        
    elif 2 <= t < 3:
        # Move from (1, 1) to (0, 1)
        start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y = side_length, side_length, 0, side_length
        x = start_x - (start_x - end_x) * (t - 2)
        y = start_y
        
    elif 3 <= t < 4:
        # Move from (0, 1) to (0, 0)
        start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y = 0, side_length, 0, 0

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important because it covers the complete square cycle)
t_range = (0, 4)
```

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Inverse_N: using a trajectory of an inverse 'N' shape.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To draw the trajectory of an inverse 'N' shape, we can break it down into straightforward linear segments. An inverse 'N' shape consists of a diagonal line ascending from a point on the left to a point on the right, followed by a vertical line descending to another point directly below the starting point. Since this is an open path and follows a simple geometric pattern, we don't need a detailed trajectory breakdown. Here's how you can define it:

### Trajectory Analysis:
1. **Segment 1 (Diagonal Up-Right):** Start from the bottom-left, move diagonally upwards to the top-right.
2. **Segment 2 (Vertical Down):** From the endpoint of segment 1, move vertically downwards to complete the inverse 'N'.

### Code Implementation:
The simplest approach is to use two segments, and ensure continuity by starting each new segment where the previous one left off.

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y = 0, 0, 1, 1
    if 0 <= t < 0.5:
        # First segment: diagonal line from (0, 0) to (1, 1)
        # Parametrization for the first half
        x = start_x + (end_x - start_x) * (t / 0.5)  # Varies from 0 to 1
        y = start_y + (end_y - start_y) * (t / 0.5)  # Varies from 0 to 1
    elif 0.5 <= t <= 1:
        # Second segment: vertical line from (1, 1) to (1, 0)
        # Reset start_x, start_y to new segment's start (1, 1)
        start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y = 1, 1, 1, 0
        # Parametrization for the second half
        x = start_x  # Constant at 1
        y = start_y + (end_y - start_y) * ((t - 0.5) / 0.5)  # Varies from 1 to 0

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 1)
```

In this implementation:
- The parameter `t` is divided into two segments [0, 0.5) and [0.5, 1].
- The function calculates `(x, y)` positions continuously across both segments without jumps.
- Uniform speed is ensured by linear interpolation within the defined segments.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = '3dots: using a trajectory that passes through three specific points not in a straight trajectory.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: Based on the description "3dots: using a trajectory that passes through three specific points not in a straight trajectory," let's break down the task:

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Since the task involves starting from one point, passing through two others, and not forming a straight line between them, this suggests an open trajectory. 

2. **Trajectory Analysis:** With three specified points not forming a straight line, we'll create a smooth curve, such as a parabola or a similar arc, that passes through these points.

Given these points, I will create a smooth, continuous trajectory. We can use an arc to guide our curve through the three points: \(P_1\), \(P_2\), and \(P_3\). For simplicity, assume the points are:

- \(P_1 = (0, 0)\)
- \(P_2 = (2, 1)\)
- \(P_3 = (4, 0)\)

I'll write the code for a trajectory using a quadratic Bezier curve, which naturally passes through the start and endpoint, with the middle point defining the "peak" or "depth" of the curve.

### Mathematical Functions:

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    # Points coordinates
    P1 = (0, 0)
    P2 = (2, 1)
    P3 = (4, 0)
    
    # Calculate the Bezier curve
    x = (1-t)**2 * P1[0] + 2*(1-t)*t * P2[0] + t**2 * P3[0]
    y = (1-t)**2 * P1[1] + 2*(1-t)*t * P2[1] + t**2 * P3[1]
    
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 1)
```

In this representation, \(t\) ranges from 0 to 1, where:

- \(t = 0\) gives us the starting point \(P_1\),
- \(t = 1\) gives us the ending point \(P_3\),
- \(t = 0.5\) or other intermediate values would give us points lying on the curve, ensuring it passes closely through \(P_2\).

This function generates a smooth trajectory that is easy to adjust for different points and respects the open nature of the shape requested.
extracted_code: def shape_curve(t):
    # Points coordinates
    P1 = (0, 0)
    P2 = (2, 1)

**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open. So, avoid using a closed trajectory for an open path like S, a common error is to make it like shape 8.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.
再次强调：为了确保平滑过渡，您需要调整每一段段的公式，使其从上一段的终点坐标开始，而不是独立地重新定义 x 和 y。如果有不同的t段落，每一段的开始坐标和结束坐标应该在注释中标注出来！start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'SDF: using a straight trajectory.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: Based on the description provided, "SDF: using a straight trajectory" implies that the trajectory is open, as it attempts to form letters rather than a closed shape.

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory is open because we are forming letters.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:** Since the description indicates straight trajectories forming the letters "SDF," it involves a sequence of straight line segments. We will translate these letters into straight segments.

   - For an "S," start at a point, move in an arc shape downward, back, and then forward.
   - For a "D," start up, curve to form a semi-circle to the right, and return to the start.
   - For an "F," trace upwards, then horizontally to the right, and then partway down.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** We will assume each letter is constructed with straight line paths for simplicity, without refined curves, forming an "S," then a "D," and lastly an "F."

Below is the simplified representation of the described letters using straight trajectories:

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    import numpy as np
    
    # Parameters to define the size and separation of each letter's drawing
    segment_length = 1.0
    separation = 0.5
    num_letters = 3
    
    # Total number of segments: S(3) + D(4) + F(3) = 10
    total_segments = 10
    segment_time = 1.0 / total_segments
    
    # Initialize x, y
    x, y = 0.0, 0.0
    
    # Determine the position along the trajectory
    if 0 <= t < segment_time * 3:  # "S"
        if 0 <= t < segment_time:
            x = t * segment_length * 3
            y = 0
        elif segment_time <= t < segment_time * 2:
            x = segment_length
            y = (t - segment_time) * segment_length * 3
        elif segment_time * 2 <= t < segment_time * 3:
            x = segment_length - (t - segment_time * 2) * segment_length * 3
            y = -segment_length
    elif segment_time * 3 <= t < segment_time * 7:  # "D"
        if segment_time * 3 <= t < segment_time * 4:
            x = segment_length * separation
            y = -(t - segment_time * 3) * segment_length * 2
        elif segment_time * 4 <= t < segment_time * 6:
            x = segment_length * separation + (t - segment_time * 4) * segment_length * 2
            y = -segment_length
        elif segment_time * 6 <= t < segment_time * 7:
            x = segment_length * separation + segment_length
            y = -(segment_length - (t - segment_time * 6) * segment_length * 2)
    elif segment_time * 7 <= t < segment_time * 10:  # "F"
        if segment_time * 7 <= t < segment_time * 8:
            x = segment_length * separation * 2
            y = -(t - segment_time * 7) * segment_length * 2
        elif segment_time * 8 <= t < segment_time * 9:
            x = segment_length * separation * 2 + (t - segment_time * 8) * segment_length
            y = -segment_length
        elif segment_time * 9 <= t < segment_time * 10:
            x = segment_length * separation * 2
            y = -(segment_length - (t - segment_time * 9) * segment_length)
    
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
t_range = (0, 1)
```

This function, `shape_curve(t)`, models the trajectory for an "SDF" using straight segments, assuming a uniform movement over time specified by `t`. Each part of the trajectory smoothly transitions into the next, with a separation between the letters for clarity.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Zigzag: using a zigzag trajectory.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To draw a zigzag trajectory, we will design a piecewise linear path that alternates direction at regular intervals. The trajectory will be open since a zigzag pattern does not typically close back on itself. Here’s how to break down and compute the zigzag trajectory:

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** This trajectory is open.

2. **Trajectory Analysis:**
   - We'll create a zigzag pattern by alternating between forward and sideways movements.
   - Each segment of the zigzag will have equal length, creating a uniform pattern.

3. **Mathematical Functions:**

We'll define the trajectory in pieces, moving alternately right and left from a center line:

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    # Determine the number of zigzag segments
    n_segments = 10  # adjust as needed for more zigzags
    segment_length = 1  # length of each zigzag segment
    segment_time = (1.0 / n_segments)

    # Determine which segment we are in
    current_segment = int(t / segment_time)
    
    # Base coordinates
    base_x = (current_segment + 0.5) * segment_length
    base_y = 0

    if current_segment % 2 == 0:
        # Even segments go upward diagonally
        x = base_x + (t % segment_time) * segment_length / segment_time
        y = (t % segment_time) * segment_length / segment_time
    else:
        # Odd segments go downward diagonally
        x = base_x + (t % segment_time) * segment_length / segment_time
        y = segment_length - (t % segment_time) * segment_length / segment_time

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
t_range = (0, 1)
```

- In this setup:
  - `n_segments` controls how many zigzag pieces there are.
  - `segment_length` sets the size of each segment.
- The trajectory functions ensure smooth transitions with consistent speed by determining the current segment based on `t` and then calculating `x` and `y` within each segment.
- This piecewise linear function loops through zigzag segments, alternating direction for each new segment.

Feel free to adjust the `n_segments` and `segment_length` variables to match the specific needs of the zigzag you'd like to create.

    # Determine the number of zigzag segments
    n_segments = 10  # adjust as needed for more zigzags

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = '135angleLeft: moving forward and then making a 135-degree turn to the left.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To draw the described trajectory, let's analyze it in steps before writing the code. The person first moves forward, then makes a 135-degree turn to the left from their initial direction and continues moving.

**Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:**
- The trajectory described is open, as it involves a forward movement and a turn, without closing back on itself.

**Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
1. Walk forward for a certain distance (let's say 10 units).
2. Make a 135-degree turn to the left.
3. Continue walking straight for the same distance after the turn.

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- Since an exact distance isn't provided, let's assume the forward movement is a straight line of length 10 units.
- After this, making a 135-degree turn to the left can be visualized as moving in a new direction, which is substantially different from a simple 90-degree or 180-degree turn.

**Mathematical Functions:**
We'll define the trajectory for `t` between 0 and 2, where:
- For 0 <= t < 1, the person moves forward.
- For 1 <= t <= 2, the person makes a 135-degree turn to the left and continues to walk.

Here's the enclosed mathematical function using linear algebra concepts:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Initial forward movement path
    if 0 <= t < 1:
        # Start at (0,0) and move forward 10 units to (10,0)
        x = 10 * t
        y = 0
        start_x, start_y = 0, 0
        end_x, end_y = 10, 0
    # 135-degree turn to the left
    elif 1 <= t <= 2:
        # Continue from the end of the first segment (10,0) onward
        angle_radians = np.radians(135)
        # Move in the new direction with coordinates adjusted by the angle
        x = 10 + 10 * (t-1) * np.cos(angle_radians)
        y = 10 * (t-1) * np.sin(angle_radians)
        start_x, start_y = 10, 0
        end_x = 10 + 10 * np.cos(angle_radians)
        end_y = 10 * np.sin(angle_radians)

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
t_range = (0, 2)
```

This function ensures smooth transitions between segments and uniform movement in time (`t`). The trajectory path starts from `(0,0)`, moves to `(10,0)`, then makes a 135-degree turn to the left, moving to `(10 + 10 * cos(135°), 10 * sin(135°))` by the end of `t = 2`. The coordinates remain continuous at each transition point.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = '120angleRight: moving forward and then making a 120-degree turn to the right.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To represent the described trajectory of moving forward and then making a 120-degree turn to the right, we need to follow these steps:

### Closed or Open Trajectory Decision
This trajectory is open because the path doesn't return to its starting point after the turn.

### Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown
1. Start moving forward in a straight line.
2. After a certain distance, make a 120-degree turn to the right.
3. Continue moving forward.

### Trajectory Analysis
To ensure a smooth trajectory, we need to express each segment in terms of mathematical functions and describe transitions neatly:
- The first segment is a straight line moving forward.
- The second segment involves a 120-degree right turn and continuing in a straight line.

For simplicity, let's assume:
- The first segment occurs over `0 <= t < 5` and moves straight along the x-axis.
- The second segment occurs over `5 <= t <= 10` and continues by turning 120 degrees to the right from the initial forward direction.

Here is the code implementing the trajectory:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    if 0 <= t < 5:
        # Starting from origin, moving forward
        # Constant forward movement in a straight line on the x-axis
        start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y = 0, 0, 5, 0
        x = t
        y = 0
    elif 5 <= t <= 10:
        # Continuing with 120-degree turn to the right
        # Turning right rotates the direction counter to normal trigonometric rotation
        start_x, start_y = 5, 0
        x = 5 + (t - 5) * np.cos(np.deg2rad(-120))  # Correct turn
        y = (t - 5) * np.sin(np.deg2rad(-120))
    else:
        x, y = None, None  # If t is outside the specified range

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 10)
```

### Explanation: 

In this code:
- For `0 <= t < 5`, the person walks forward in a straight line.
- For `5 <= t <= 10`, the person makes a right turn of 120 degrees and continues moving in a straight line.
- The continuity of the path is ensured by updating the starting point of the second segment to align with the end of the first segment.
- Note that `np.deg2rad(-120)` is used to convert the 120-degree right turn to radians, and the use of negative is appropriate for a rightward direction.

This simplified approach ensures the described trajectory, executed at a uniform pace.

**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open. So, avoid using a closed trajectory for an open path like S, a common error is to make it like shape 8.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = '110angleRight: moving forward and then making a 110-degree turn to the right.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To draw the described trajectory of moving forward and then making a 110-degree turn to the right, we need to break it down into two segments: a straight path followed by a turn.

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:**  
   This is an open trajectory because it involves a straight path and a turn without returning to the starting point.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**  
   - **Segment 1:** Walk forward in a straight line.
   - **Segment 2:** Turn 110 degrees to the right from the forward direction and continue in a straight line.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:**  
   The trajectory consists of two segments with smooth transitions without overlaps. The continuity ensures a seamless transition from the straight path to the right-turn path.

Let's assume the initial path is in the positive x-direction, and for simplicity, let's choose arbitrary distances (e.g., 5 units each segment). We'll use a parametric form for `t` to ensure even spacing and continuity:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    if 0 <= t < 0.5:  # Segment 1: Move forward in a straight line
        # Linear movement forward
        start_x, start_y = 0, 0
        end_x, end_y = 5, 0
        x = start_x + (end_x - start_x) * (t / 0.5)
        y = start_y + (end_y - start_y) * (t / 0.5)
    elif 0.5 <= t <= 1.0:  # Segment 2: Turn 110 degrees right and continue
        # Calculate turn (110-degree right turn)
        # This involves a turn to a new angle for the second segment
        angle_rad = np.radians(110)
        start_x, start_y = 5, 0
        end_x, end_y = 5 + 5 * np.cos(angle_rad), -5 * np.sin(angle_rad)
        x = start_x + (end_x - start_x) * ((t - 0.5) / 0.5)
        y = start_y + (end_y - start_y) * ((t - 0.5) / 0.5)
    else:
        raise ValueError("t should be in the range [0, 1]")

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
t_range = (0, 1)
```

In this code:
- For the first half of `t` (`0 <= t < 0.5`), the person moves forward along the x-axis.
- For the second half (`0.5 <= t <= 1.0`), the person turns 110 degrees to the right, continuing from their point at the end of the first segment.

Each segment is smoothly connected and ensures uniform speed across the whole trajectory. The coordinates transition smoothly between segments to maintain a continuous path.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = '90angleRight: moving forward and then making a 90-degree turn to the right.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To address the task, let's break down the description of the trajectory and convert it into a mathematical representation suitable for a function.

### Trajectory Analysis and Breakdown:

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:**
   - This trajectory is open because it starts with moving forward and then turns 90 degrees to the right without forming a closed loop.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
   - The description "90angleRight: moving forward and then making a 90-degree turn to the right" can be broken down as follows:
     - Move forward in a straight line.
     - At a certain point, turn 90 degrees to the right and continue in a new straight line.

3. **Mathematical Representation:**
   - Let's break it down into two segments:
     - **Segment 1:** Moving forward in the positive y-direction.
     - **Segment 2:** Turning 90 degrees right, then moving in the positive x-direction.
   - The movement is represented with two linear segments.

4. **Define the Range of `t`:**
   - We'll choose a range of `t` that divides the movement into two equal parts for simplicity.

Below is the Python code implementing the above trajectory:

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    if 0 <= t < 0.5:  # Segment 1: Moving forward
        # Start from (0, 0), end at (0, 1)
        x = 0
        y = 2 * t
    elif 0.5 <= t <= 1:  # Segment 2: 90-degree turn to the right
        # Start from (0, 1), end at (1, 1)
        x = 2 * (t - 0.5)
        y = 1
    else:
        raise ValueError("t should be within the range [0, 1].")

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
t_range = (0, 1)
```

### Explanation:
- **Segment 1 `(0 <= t < 0.5)`**: Move vertically up. The initial position is (0, 0), and it moves up to (0, 1). This is a straight line along the y-axis.
- **Segment 2 `(0.5 <= t <= 1)`**: After reaching (0, 1), the trajectory turns right towards the x-direction from (0, 1) to (1, 1), moving horizontally.

Each segment ensures a smooth transition with consistent speed, beginning where the previous segment ended. This implementation should correctly follow the described movement and avoid any abrupt changes or "jumps."

    if 0 <= t < 0.5:  # Segment 1: Moving forward

        y = 2 * t

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = '60angleRight: moving forward and then making a 60-degree turn to the right.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To address the given task, we need to determine whether the trajectory should be closed or open. Based on the description, it involves moving forward and then making a 60-degree turn to the right. This suggests an open trajectory as it does not mention returning to the starting point or forming a closed shape.

Let's break down the movement:

1. **Initial Movement**: Move forward in a straight line.
2. **Turning**: Make a 60-degree turn to the right.

Given this, we can create the function `shape_curve(t)` to represent this trajectory. We'll assume a simple forward movement followed by a 60-degree turn in a smooth arc.

Here's how to implement this in Python:

```python
import math

def shape_curve(t):
    # Define each segment of the trajectory        
    if t <= 1:
        # Forward movement for the first segment
        start_x, start_y = 0, 0
        end_x, end_y = t, 0
        x = start_x + (end_x - start_x) * t
        y = start_y + (end_y - start_y) * t
    else:
        # After t=1, start turning for the 60-degree arc
        start_x, start_y = 1, 0
        angle_rad = (t - 1) * math.pi / 3  # 60 degrees in radians
        radius = 1  # Assume a circular arc with radius 1
        end_x = start_x + radius * (1 - math.cos(angle_rad))
        end_y = start_y + radius * math.sin(angle_rad)
        x = start_x + (end_x - start_x)
        y = start_y + (end_y - start_y)

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
t_range = (0, 2)
```

### Explanation:

- **Segment 1**: From `t = 0` to `t = 1`, the path is a straight line moving forward. This is generated using a simple linear function where `x` moves from 0 to 1 while `y` remains constant.

- **Segment 2**: From `t = 1` onward, there's a smooth right turn of 60 degrees. The trajectory is defined using trigonometric functions to simulate the circular arc.

This trajectory is open, as it hasn't described a closed loop or return to the starting position. The variable `radius` was chosen for simplicity, assuming the forward motion unit is 1 (you can adjust the radius further if needed). The choice of `t_range` assumes uniform forward and then turning motion. Adjust as needed for more detailed movement.

1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = '30angleLeft: moving forward and then making a 30-degree turn to the left.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: Based on the given description, the trajectory is open because it involves moving forward and turning without circling back to the starting point. Let's break down the trajectory:

1. **Initial Movement:** Move straight forward.
2. **Turn:** Make a 30-degree turn to the left and continue moving forward.

**Trajectory Analysis:**

- The movement begins with a straight path forward.
- After an initial period, a smooth transition occurs into a 30-degree left turn, continuing in this new direction.

Here's how we can express this motion mathematically:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Initial straight path
    if t <= t_turn:
        # Moving straight forward
        x = initial_v * t
        y = 0
    else:
        # After the 30-degree left turn
        delta_t = t - t_turn  # Time after the turn
        angle_rad = np.radians(30)  # Convert 30 degrees to radians
        x = initial_v * t_turn + turn_v * np.cos(angle_rad) * delta_t
        y = turn_v * np.sin(angle_rad) * delta_t
    
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
# Assuming the turn occurs at t = 1 for simplicity
initial_v = 1  # Initial velocity along the x-axis
turn_v = 1  # Velocity after the turn
t_turn = 1
t_range = (0, 3)
```

**Explanation:**

- **Initial Movement (`t <= t_turn`):** The person moves straight forward along the x-axis with a constant speed until time `t_turn`.
- **After 30-Degree Turn (`t > t_turn`):** The person makes a left turn and continues in a new direction at the same speed. The trajectory is adjusted by a 30-degree angle using trigonometric functions with the turn's velocity components: `cos(angle)` for x and `sin(angle)` for y.

This code assumes that the transition to the new direction happens at time `t_turn`, and the motion is continuous and smooth throughout the entire range of `t`.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = '30angleRight: moving forward and then making a 30-degree turn to the right.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To draw the described trajectory accurately, let's break down the movement and then provide the mathematical function:

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** This trajectory appears to be open since there is no mention of returning to the starting point or forming a loop.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
   - Start by moving straight forward.
   - After completing the forward segment, turn 30 degrees to the right and continue moving.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** The described movement involves two main parts: a straight line and then a turn followed by another straight segment. The trajectory will change direction by 30 degrees to the right after the initial forward movement.

4. **Mathematical Functions:** We will compose the function such that it incorporates both segments smoothly, ensuring a continuous trajectory with proper alignment at the transition point.

Here's how we can define this trajectory function:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    if t < 1:
        # First segment: move forward in a straight line
        # Starting point: (0, 0), Ending point: (5, 0)
        start_x, start_y = (0, 0)
        end_x, end_y = (5, 0)
        
        # Linear interpolation for x
        x = start_x + (end_x - start_x) * t
        y = start_y + (end_y - start_y) * t
    else:
        # Second segment: turn 30 degrees to the right and move forward
        # Starting point is the end of the first segment: (5, 0)
        start_x, start_y = (5, 0)
        angle_radians = np.radians(30)
        distance = 5 * (t - 1)  # Continue moving 5 more units after turning
        x = start_x + distance * np.cos(angle_radians)
        y = start_y + distance * np.sin(angle_radians)

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
# 0 <= t < 1 for the first segment, 1 <= t < 2 for the second segment
t_range = (0, 2)
```

- **Segment 1:** Moves forward in a straight line from (0, 0) to (5, 0) as \( t \) goes from 0 to 1.
- **Segment 2:** Takes a 30-degree right turn from the end of the first segment and moves to a new endpoint from \( t=1 \) to \( t=2 \).

This code ensures a smooth transition between the segments and a uniform speed of movement.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'CapitalJ: using a trajectory resembling the capital letter 'J'.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To create a trajectory resembling the capital letter 'J', we need to make sure that the path mimics the shape effectively. The letter 'J' comprises a straight vertical line followed by a smooth curve forming a hook. 

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:**
   - The trajectory for the letter 'J' is open because it does not return to its starting point.

2. **Trajectory Analysis:**
   - Start with a vertical line descending from the top.
   - Finish with a semi-circular curve at the bottom that forms the hook of the 'J'.

Here's how we can break down the shape:
- Move vertically downwards for the straight part of the 'J'.
- Form a quarter-circle for the hook at the bottom.

3. **Mathematical Functions:**
   - For the vertical line: This can be parameterized as moving along the y-axis for a range of t.
   - For the hook: A quarter-circle, which can be described using trigonometric functions.

Let's write the function `shape_curve(t)`:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    if t < 1.0:  # Vertical line part, t from 0 to 1
        # Linear equation for vertical line
        x = 0
        y = -(5 * t)  # Move downwards from 0 to -5 as t goes from 0 to 1
    else:  # Quarter-circle part, t from 1 to 2
        t = t - 1.0
        # Parametric equation for the quarter-circle
        x = 5 * np.sin(np.pi * t * 0.5)  # 0 to 5 as t goes from 0 to 1
        y = -5 + 5 * np.cos(np.pi * t * 0.5)  # Keep it continuous from -5 to -10

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 2)
```

In this code:
- For \(0 \leq t < 1\), we create the vertical line by keeping x constant and varying y linearly.
- For \(1 \leq t \leq 2\), the quarter-circle is generated using parametric equations based on sine and cosine to smoothly transition for the semicircular arc.
- The trajectory starts at (0, 0), transitions smoothly at (0, -5), and ends at approximately (5, -10) with the transition ensuring continuity and smoothness.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'CapitalL: using a trajectory resembling the capital letter 'L'.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To create a trajectory that resembles the capital letter 'L', we need an open path. The shape of the letter 'L' is formed by an initial vertical line followed by a horizontal line. Let's break down this movement into two segments:

1. **Vertical Segment:** Start vertically down.
2. **Horizontal Segment:** Move horizontally to the right.

Since this is a simple trajectory, we can directly provide the function without further breakdown. We will use parameter `t` such that it smoothly transitions from the vertical to the horizontal segment. 

In this scenario:
- The vertical segment goes from `(0, 0)` to `(0, -1)`.
- The horizontal segment goes from `(0, -1)` to `(1, -1)`.

Let's define this trajectory in code:

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    if 0 <= t < 0.5:
        # Vertical line: from (0, 0) to (0, -1)
        start_x, start_y = 0, 0
        end_x, end_y = 0, -1
        # Linear interpolation
        x = start_x
        y = start_y + (end_y - start_y) * (t / 0.5)
    elif 0.5 <= t <= 1:
        # Horizontal line: from (0, -1) to (1, -1)
        start_x, start_y = 0, -1
        end_x, end_y = 1, -1
        # Linear interpolation
        x = start_x + (end_x - start_x) * ((t - 0.5) / 0.5)
        y = start_y

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
t_range = (0, 1)
```

This function defines the letter 'L' trajectory:
- For `0 <= t < 0.5`, it draws the vertical line from `(0, 0)` to `(0, -1)`.
- For `0.5 <= t <= 1`, it draws the horizontal line from `(0, -1)` to `(1, -1)`.

The transition from vertical to horizontal is smooth, maintaining a consistent speed of movement.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'CapitalU: using a trajectory resembling the capital letter 'U'.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: Based on the description, the trajectory resembles the capital letter 'U'. This means it's an open trajectory, as it starts from one end of the 'U' and ends at the other without closing the shape.

### Trajectory Analysis:

To create a 'U' shape, we need a curve at the bottom and two vertical lines reaching upwards:

1. **Starting Point**: Begin at the top-left of the 'U'.
2. **Vertical Downward Line**: Move downward.
3. **Bottom Curve**: Transition smoothly through a semicircular curve.
4. **Vertical Upward Line**: Move upward to end at the top-right of the 'U'.

### Mathematical Representation:

For the 'U' shape, we can consider combining linear functions for vertical lines and a semicircle function for the curve:

1. **First Segment** (downward vertical line):
   - Move from the top-left to the bottom-left.
2. **Second Segment** (semicircular bottom curve):
   - Transition from the left bottom to the bottom right in a semicircular fashion.
3. **Third Segment** (upward vertical line):
   - Move from the bottom-right upward to the top-right.

Below is the Python code that implements the above trajectory:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Determine the segment based on t value
    if 0 <= t < 1:
        # First Segment: Vertical downward line
        start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y = -1, 1, -1, -1
        x = start_x
        y = start_y - (start_y - end_y) * t
    elif 1 <= t < 2:
        # Second Segment: Semicircular bottom curve
        angle = np.pi * (t - 1)  # Ranges from 0 to pi
        radius = 1
        start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y = -1, -1, 1, -1
        x = start_x + radius * (1 + np.cos(angle))
        y = start_y + radius * np.sin(angle)
    elif 2 <= t <= 3:
        # Third Segment: Vertical upward line
        start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y = 1, -1, 1, 1
        x = start_x
        y = start_y + (end_y - start_y) * (t - 2)

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
t_range = (0, 3)
```

This code is structured to ensure smooth transitions between segments while maintaining a uniform trajectory speed. The `shape_curve(t)` function covers the continuous movement needed to draw the 'U' shape as described.

**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open. So, avoid using a closed trajectory for an open path like S, a common error is to make it like shape 8.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'CapitalV: using a trajectory resembling the capital letter 'V'.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To draw a trajectory that resembles the capital letter 'V', we need to visualize a simple open path that starts at one point, descends diagonally, and then ascends diagonally to another point, creating a 'V' shape.

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** 
   - The trajectory is open since we are creating the shape of the letter 'V', which does not connect back to the starting point.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:**
   - The path of 'V' involves two straight lines:
     1. A line descending to the right.
     2. A line ascending to the right.
   - This trajectory has no overlapping sections.
   
4. **Mathematical Functions:**
   - We will define a linear function for each segment and ensure continuity between these functions.

Let's define the piecewise function for the shape of a 'V':

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    if 0 <= t < 0.5:
        # From the start point to the middle of 'V', descending part
        start_x, start_y = 0, 0
        end_x, end_y = 1, -1
        x = (end_x - start_x) * (t / 0.5) + start_x
        y = (end_y - start_y) * (t / 0.5) + start_y
    elif 0.5 <= t <= 1:
        # From the middle of 'V' to the endpoint, ascending part
        start_x, start_y = 1, -1
        end_x, end_y = 2, 0
        x = (end_x - start_x) * ((t - 0.5) / 0.5) + start_x
        y = (end_y - start_y) * ((t - 0.5) / 0.5) + start_y

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
t_range = (0, 1)
```

**Explanation:**
- The trajectory is divided into two segments.
- **First Segment (0 <= t < 0.5):** It describes the descending part of the 'V'.
  - Starts at (0, 0) and ends at (1, -1).
- **Second Segment (0.5 <= t <= 1):** It describes the ascending part of the 'V'.
  - Starts at (1, -1) and ends at (2, 0).
- The function ensures there are smooth transitions between the segments, with each segment's start aligning with the previous end point.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'CapitalZ: using a trajectory resembling the capital letter 'Z'.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To represent the trajectory resembling the capital letter 'Z', we need to construct an open trajectory that consists of three linear segments. The first segment is a diagonal line moving from the top left to the bottom right, the second segment is a horizontal line moving to the left, and the third segment is another diagonal line from the bottom left to the top right.

**Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory is open because it represents the letter 'Z'.

**Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
1. Diagonally down and right.
2. Move straight left.
3. Diagonally up and right.

**Trajectory Analysis:**
1. First segment starts at the top-left point, moving diagonally to the bottom-right.
2. Second segment goes horizontally left.
3. Final segment rises diagonally towards the top-right.

Let's define the mathematical function in Python to represent this trajectory:

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    if 0 <= t < 1:
        # First segment: start at (0, 0) and move to (1, -1)
        start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y = 0, 0, 1, -1
        x = (end_x - start_x) * t + start_x
        y = (end_y - start_y) * t + start_y
    elif 1 <= t < 2:
        # Second segment: move from (1, -1) to (0, -1)
        start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y = 1, -1, 0, -1
        x = (end_x - start_x) * (t - 1) + start_x
        y = start_y  # remains constant
    elif 2 <= t <= 3:
        # Third segment: move from (0, -1) to (1, 0)
        start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y = 0, -1, 1, 0
        x = (end_x - start_x) * (t - 2) + start_x

# Specify the range of t (it is important)

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Number0: using a trajectory resembling the number '0'.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To represent the trajectory resembling the number '0', we need to create an elliptical or circular path. The trajectory will be closed since the number '0' forms a loop. In this scenario, we can utilize parametric equations that produce a smooth circular shape.

Here's the code:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Define the radius of the circle
    a = 5  # Horizontal radius
    b = 10 # Vertical radius
    
    # Parametric equations for an ellipse
    x = a * np.cos(t)
    y = b * np.sin(t)

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t which represents the full loop of the number '0'
t_range = (0, 2 * np.pi)  # Full circle range
```

This code uses parametric equations for an ellipse, where `x = a * cos(t)` and `y = b * sin(t)` with `a` and `b` being the semi-major and semi-minor axes, respectively. The range of `t` is from `0` to `2π`, which completes one full loop, effectively drawing the shape of a '0'. Adjust `a` and `b` to change the proportions if necessary.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Number1: using a trajectory resembling the number '1'.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To represent the trajectory of the numerical digit "1", we will assume a vertical line, given the simplicity and the typical representation of the number "1".

**Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:**
The trajectory resembling the number "1" is an open trajectory.

Since this is a straightforward case of a vertical line, we can skip the detailed fixed format breakdown and move on to providing the trajectory function.

Let's design this as a simple linear vertical movement:

**Trajectory Analysis:**
1. Start at a lower point and move directly upwards.
2. We will represent the trajectory of the number "1" as a vertical line that ensures a consistent vertical increment over a specified range of `t`.

Here's the code that represents this trajectory:

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    # Linear vertical line representing the number "1"
    # Start at a point (x=0, y=-1) and go to (x=0, y=1)
    x = 0  # constant, as we are drawing a straight vertical line
    y = -1 + 2 * t  # the y-coordinate increases from -1 to 1 as t goes from 0 to 1

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 1)
```

This function `shape_curve(t)` will trace out a straight line upward along the y-axis, perfectly resembling the number "1". The `t` parameter ranges from 0 to 1, allowing for a smooth and uniform traversal of the trajectory.
extracted_code: def shape_curve(t):
    # Linear vertical line representing the number "1"
    # Start at a point (x=0, y=-1) and go to (x=0, y=1)
    x = 0  # constant, as we are drawing a straight vertical line
    y = -1 + 2 * t  # the y-coordinate increases from -1 to 1 as t goes from 0 to 1

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)

**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open. So, avoid using a closed trajectory for an open path like S, a common error is to make it like shape 8.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Number7: using a trajectory resembling the number '7'.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: Based on the description, the trajectory is open because it resembles the number '7', which involves a vertical and horizontal line with a sharp corner. This is not a closed geometric figure since you don't end where you started.

Since the shape is simple, I'll skip the detailed breakdown and directly provide the code for the open trajectory:

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    # t is expected to range from 0 to 1 to cover the whole "Number 7" line.
    
    # Define the start and end points for the different segments of '7'
    
    # Start at the top left of "7"
    if t <= 0.5:
        # Horizontal top line (left to right)
        # The horizontal line from (0, 1) to (1, 1)
        # Horizontal movement
        x = t * 2  # From 0 to 1
        y = 1
    else:
        # Vertical downward line
        # The vertical line from (1, 1) to (1, 0)
        # Vertical movement
        x = 1
        y = 2 - t * 2  # From 1 to 0 (as t goes from 0.5 to 1)

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (important for an open trajectory)
t_range = (0, 1)
```

### Explanation:
- From `t = 0` to `t = 0.5`, the trajectory moves horizontally from `(0, 1)` to `(1, 1)`.
- From `t = 0.5` to `t = 1`, it moves vertically from `(1, 1)` downward to `(1, 0)`.

The entire trajectory smoothly connects as a representation of the number '7' without any jumps.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Number8: using a trajectory resembling the number '8'.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To create a trajectory resembling the number "8," we will design a closed-loop trajectory. This trajectory will have two loops, one on top of the other, similar to the figure-eight pattern.

**Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:**
The trajectory should be closed as it forms a continuous loop resembling the number "8" shape.

**Trajectory Analysis:**
The number "8" can be represented using circular or elliptical loops. We will use two loops for this design: one at the top and one at the bottom. We'll ensure these loops connect smoothly, avoiding any abrupt shifts.

**Mathematical Functions:**
We'll use a combination of circular functions to represent the trajectory. For simplicity and elegance, the parameter `t` will range from \(0\) to \(2\pi\) for each loop, creating a smooth figure-eight path.

**Final Code:**

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Top loop of the '8'
    if t <= np.pi:
        x = np.sin(t)
        y = np.cos(t)
    # Bottom loop of the '8'
    else:
        x = np.sin(t)
        y = -np.cos(t)
        
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t - it completes a full '8' shape
t_range = (0, 2 * np.pi)
```

This implementation uses parametric equations for a circle, offset and manipulated to form two loops, creating an '8' shape. The loops are smoothly connected at \(t = 0\) and \(t = \pi\), ensuring continuity and uniform motion across the trajectory.

def shape_curve(t):

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.

Model: To translate the given description into a trajectory, we will define a set of linear movements with specific directions based on the clock positions. The description implies an open trajectory that sketches out three linear segments with two turns.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown and the function implementation:

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:**
   - The described trajectory is open because it involves a sequence of linear movements without circling back to the starting point.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
   - "Walk forward for a certain distance": This will be represented by a straight line segment.
   - "Turn towards 10 o'clock and continue walking": This represents a change in direction relative to the initial line.
   - "Turn towards 10 o'clock again and continue walking": Another change in direction with respect to the last segment.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:**
   - Assume each segment represents equal unit length for simplicity and uniform speed, and the angle for the 10 o'clock direction relative to the forward direction can be considered as approximately 150 degrees counter-clockwise.
   - Ensure continuity at each turn to have a smooth trajectory with no jumps.

Now, here's the function implementation:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Trajectory segments definition based on time t
    if 0 <= t < 1:
        # Initial straight line
        x = t
        y = 0
    elif 1 <= t < 2:
        # First turn towards 10 o'clock (relative angle of 150 degrees)
        start_x, start_y = 1, 0
        x = start_x + (t - 1) * np.cos(np.radians(150))
        y = start_y + (t - 1) * np.sin(np.radians(150))
    elif 2 <= t <= 3:
        # Second turn, again towards 10 o'clock from the new direction
        start_x = 1 + np.cos(np.radians(150))
        start_y = np.sin(np.radians(150))
        x = start_x + (t - 2) * np.cos(np.radians(150) * 2)
        y = start_y + (t - 2) * np.sin(np.radians(150) * 2)
    else:
        # Return None if t is outside of the specified range
        return None, None

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
t_range = (0, 3)
```

**Explanation:**

- The trajectory is divided into three segments, each defined over unit intervals of `t`.
- The function ensures each segment starts from the endpoint of the previous one, using trigonometric functions to calculate new `x` and `y` based on the given directions.
- Each directional turn is approximately 150 degrees from the direction of the previous segment to reflect the 10 o'clock position properly.
- The range of `t` is from 0 to 3, covering all parts of the open trajectory.

**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open. So, avoid using a closed trajectory for an open path like S, a common error is to make it like shape 8.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.
再次强调：为了确保平滑过渡，您需要调整每一段段的公式，使其从上一段的终点坐标开始，而不是独立地重新定义 x 和 y。如果有不同的t段落，每一段的开始坐标和结束坐标应该在注释中标注出来！start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y

    ...

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)

```

---

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Walk forward, and turn right and continue walking, and turn right and continue walking.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: Based on the description provided, the trajectory forms a simple square path as the person walks forward and makes two right turns, indicating a closed trajectory. There is no need for a complex breakdown since this is straightforward.

Let's break down the trajectory as follows:

1. **Initial Walk**: Walk forward in a straight line.
2. **First Turn**: Turn right and walk forward in a straight line.
3. **Second Turn**: Turn right again and walk forward in a straight line, completing the square path.

### Trajectory Analysis
- **Closed Trajectory**: We have a square because the person makes two 90-degree turns and continues walking.
- **Key Points**: The square's sides are all equal as the person walks equal distances after each turn.

Here's the code following the specified output requirements:

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    # Each side of the square corresponds to a certain range of 't'
    if 0 <= t < 1:
        # Move forward (right)
        x = t
        y = 0
        # Start (0, 0), End (1, 0)
    elif 1 <= t < 2:

This code defines a square trajectory, ensuring smooth transitions between each segment. The person's overall path forms a closed loop, tracing a square shape by making two right-angle turns and returning to the starting point. Each segment aligns with the preceding one for continuity.

**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open. So, avoid using a closed trajectory for an open path like S, a common error is to make it like shape 8.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.
再次强调：为了确保平滑过渡，您需要调整每一段段的公式，使其从上一段的终点坐标开始，而不是独立地重新定义 x 和 y。如果有不同的t段落，每一段的开始坐标和结束坐标应该在注释中标注出来！start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Zigzag: using a zigzag trajectory.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To represent a zigzag trajectory, we need to draw a series of linear segments that alternate direction, forming a zigzag pattern. This pattern is open because it doesn't enclose an area like a shape would.

### Trajectory Analysis:
In a zigzag trajectory:
1. The movement alternates between two directions (e.g., left to right and right to left).
2. Each segment should maintain a uniform speed, implying constant x and y changes over time.

Here's the simplified trajectory breakdown for a zigzag pattern that consists of a few segments moving diagonally back and forth:

- Move diagonally up-right.
- Move diagonally down-right.
- Repeat the above pattern.

### Mathematical Representation:
We'll represent this pattern with a function \( \text{shape_curve}(t) \), ensuring smooth transitions and uniform speed throughout the trajectory.

### Code for Zigzag Trajectory:
```python
def shape_curve(t):
    # Define parameters for zigzag dimensions and frequency
    a = 10  # Amplitude of the zigzag
    b = 5   # Length of each zigzag segment
    
    # Choose frequency such that it completes one zig-zag pattern over 0 to 2pi
    frequency = 2  # Controls how many zigzags we have over a period

    # Calculate x and y based on t
    x = a * t
    y = b * (-1) ** int(t * frequency)

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t to cover several zigzag peaks and troughs
t_range = (0, 5)  # Alter this range to change the number of zigzag segments
```

### Explanation:
- **Amplitude (a):** Determines the horizontal spacing between peaks.
- **Length (b):** Defines the vertical height of each zigzag segment.
- **Frequency:** Determines how quickly the direction changes for the zigzag effect.

This code models a zigzag path using simple mathematical expressions, implementing uniform motion as \( t \) progresses. Adjust `a`, `b`, and `t_range` to adapt the trajectory's size and complexity.

    # Define parameters for zigzag dimensions and frequency

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = '135angleLeft: moving forward and then making a 135-degree turn to the left.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To achieve the described trajectory of "moving forward and then making a 135-degree turn to the left," we need to break down the movement into two segments: moving forward in a straight line and then turning 135 degrees to the left. This results in an open trajectory since the movement does not loop back to the starting point.

### Trajectory Analysis & Breakdown:
1. **Segment 1**: Move forward in a straight line.
2. **Segment 2**: Make a 135-degree turn to the left and continue in a straight line.

We need to ensure a continuous trajectory without abrupt transitions between segments. We'll use linear segments and adjust based on `t`.

### Mathematical Functions:

1. The first segment will be a linear path.
2. The second segment will involve a change in direction – specifically, a 135-degree turn to the left.

Here is the Python code implementing the described path:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    if t < 0.5:
        # First segment: moving forward
        start_x, start_y = 0, 0
        end_x, end_y = 10, 0  # Moving forward by 10 units
        x = start_x + (end_x - start_x) * (t / 0.5)
        y = start_y + (end_y - start_y) * (t / 0.5)
    else:
        # Second segment: turning 135 degrees to the left and then moving forward
        # 135 degrees left means 45 degrees below the horizontal on the left side (or equivalently -135 degrees from the positive x-axis)
        start_x, start_y = 10, 0
        angle = np.deg2rad(-135)
        # Calculating end position after 135 degree turn (assume 10 units again)
        dx, dy = 10 * np.cos(angle), 10 * np.sin(angle)
        end_x, end_y = start_x + dx, start_y + dy
        x = start_x + (end_x - start_x) * ((t - 0.5) / 0.5)
        y = start_y + (end_y - start_y) * ((t - 0.5) / 0.5)

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
t_range = (0, 1)
```

### Explanation:
- **Segment 1**: From `t = 0` to `t = 0.5`, the person moves forward in a straight line from (0, 0) to (10, 0).
- **Segment 2**: From `t = 0.5` to `t = 1`, the person turns 135 degrees to their left and continues moving forward to approximately (-3.07, -7.07).

This trajectory smoothly transitions between the two segments, maintaining uniform speed throughout.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = '90angleRight: moving forward and then making a 90-degree turn to the right.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To address this description, we need to create a trajectory where a person initially moves forward and then makes a 90-degree turn to the right. This produces an open trajectory that resembles an "L" shape.

Here’s how we can break down the movement:

1. **Initial Movement:** The person moves forward in a straight line.
2. **Turn:** After a certain distance, the person makes a 90-degree turn to the right.
3. **Second Movement:** Following the turn, the person continues to move in a straight line in the new direction.

Let's translate this into a mathematical function for `shape_curve(t)`. Assuming the initial movement is along the y-axis and the person starts at the origin (0,0), they move vertically before turning right to move along the x-axis.

**Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory is open because it does not loop back to the starting point.

**Trajectory Analysis:** The function accounts for two segments:
- First segment: A straight vertical path upward.
- Second segment: A straight rightward path following a 90-degree turn.

Now let's define the code for this trajectory:

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    if t < 0.5:
        # First segment (straight forward on the y-axis)
        start_x, start_y = 0, 0  # Starting point
        end_x, end_y = 0, 5      # End point after moving forward
        x = start_x
        y = start_y + (t / 0.5) * (end_y - start_y)
    
    else:
        # Second segment (turn and move on the x-axis)
        start_x, start_y = 0, 5  # Starting point after turn
        end_x, end_y = 5, 5      # End point after moving right
        x = start_x + ((t - 0.5) / 0.5) * (end_x - start_x)
        y = end_y

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (important for proper function)
t_range = (0, 1)
```

This function represents a movement starting from the origin, initially moving upward, then turning right. The speed is uniform throughout the trajectory, with `t` ranging from 0 to 1.
extracted_code: def shape_curve(t):
    if t < 0.5:

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = '30angleRight: moving forward and then making a 30-degree turn to the right.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To draw the described trajectory of moving forward and then making a 30-degree turn to the right, let's go through the process you've outlined:

### Trajectory Analysis

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision**: This is an open trajectory. The description specifies a forward movement followed by a turn, and there is no indication of returning to the starting point, forming a loop or closed path.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown**:
   - Move forward in a straight line: Let's assume the person moves forward for 10 meters.
   - Turn 30 degrees to the right and continue moving forward for another 10 meters.

3. **Trajectory Analysis**:
   - We will break down the trajectory into two segments: 
     - **Segment 1**: Moving straight forward.
     - **Segment 2**: Turning 30 degrees to the right and continuing to move forward.
   - We'll ensure that the transition between segments is smooth.

### Mathematical Functions

We'll use parametric equations to represent the x and y coordinates over time `t`. The movement is linear for both segments with the transition happening at `t=0.5`.

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Define initial position
    start_x, start_y = 0, 0

    # Trajectory parameters
    forward_distance = 10
    angle_radians = np.radians(30)

    if t < 0.5:
        # Segment 1: Moving Straight Forward
        ratio = t / 0.5  # Normalized time for the first segment
        x = start_x + forward_distance * ratio
        y = start_y
    else:
        # Segment 2: Turn 30 degrees to the right
        ratio = (t - 0.5) / 0.5  # Normalized time for the second segment
        start_x = forward_distance  # End of Segment 1

### Explanation

- **First Segment (0 <= t < 0.5)**: Moves forward in a straight line. The `x` coordinate increases linearly while the `y` coordinate remains unchanged.
  
- **Second Segment (0.5 <= t <= 1)**: After the first segment, the path turns 30 degrees to the right. The new direction is handled by computing the change in `x` and `y` using cosine and sine of 30 degrees, respectively.

We've ensured a seamless transition between the segments for smooth trajectory drawing, with consistent speed maintained throughout. The function is ready to use, and the range of `t` from 0 to 1 represents the full trajectory.
