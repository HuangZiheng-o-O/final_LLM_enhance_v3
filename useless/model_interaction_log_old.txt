User: **Task:** Generate keyframes of a continuous trajectory to represent a specified shape. It's a trajectory for a human, and sharp turns should be avoided.

### **Step 0 :use 1~2 sentences to describe the curve that form the shape we want.
for example, when it comes to heart shape, it should feature a smooth, continuous curve, with a gentle peak at the top and a rounded bottom, avoiding any sharp angles.
Above is just an example of how to describe the curve.JUST EXAMPLE,NOT THE TASK DESCRIPTION.
### **Step 1 : Define the shape/curve using precise parametric equations or mathematical functions.**

REMEMBER: I NEED CONCISION, AND ALSO SIMPLICITY.

For example, when designing a shape, such as a heart, it's better to use an accurate representation rather than relying on simplified forms like the cardioid. But cardioid is also acceptable.
Above is just an example.JUST EXAMPLE,NOT THE TASK DESIGNING.
So,  you can design it yourself:def shape_curve(t) or use simple ones, just make sure it is simple and precise.
Ensure the curve accurately represents the shape, avoiding sharp turns whenever possible.

Important:Because latter I will sample keyframes from the curve you designed, I prefers to keep curves simple while maintaining precision to ensure that sampled keyframes can effectively represent the original shape. I want to avoid complexity that could make sampled points less representative of the shape.
For example, if a spiral shape is required, ensure it doesn't create too many loops—only two or three circles may be enough.
AGAIN: Above is just an example to show that you pay attention to simplicity.

User: **Task:** Generate keyframes of a continuous trajectory to represent a specified shape. It's a trajectory for a human, and sharp turns should be avoided.

### **Step 0 :use 1~2 sentences to describe the curve that form the shape we want.
for example, when it comes to heart shape, it should feature a smooth, continuous curve, with a gentle peak at the top and a rounded bottom, avoiding any sharp angles.
Above is just an example of how to describe the curve.JUST EXAMPLE,NOT THE TASK DESCRIPTION.
### **Step 1 : Define the shape/curve using precise parametric equations or mathematical functions.**

REMEMBER: I NEED CONCISION, AND ALSO SIMPLICITY.

For example, when designing a shape, such as a heart, it's better to use an accurate representation rather than relying on simplified forms like the cardioid. But cardioid is also acceptable.
Above is just an example.JUST EXAMPLE,NOT THE TASK DESIGNING.
So,  you can design it yourself:def shape_curve(t) or use simple ones, just make sure it is simple and precise.
Ensure the curve accurately represents the shape, avoiding sharp turns whenever possible.

Important:Because latter I will sample keyframes from the curve you designed, I prefers to keep curves simple while maintaining precision to ensure that sampled keyframes can effectively represent the original shape. I want to avoid complexity that could make sampled points less representative of the shape.
For example, if a spiral shape is required, ensure it doesn't create too many loops—only two or three circles may be enough.
AGAIN: Above is just an example to show that you pay attention to simplicity.

User: **Task:** Generate keyframes of a continuous trajectory to represent a specified shape. It's a trajectory for a human, and sharp turns should be avoided.

### **Step 0 :use 1~2 sentences to describe the curve that form the shape we want.
for example, when it comes to heart shape, it should feature a smooth, continuous curve, with a gentle peak at the top and a rounded bottom, avoiding any sharp angles.
Above is just an example of how to describe the curve.JUST EXAMPLE,NOT THE TASK DESCRIPTION.
### **Step 1 : Define the shape/curve using precise parametric equations or mathematical functions.**

REMEMBER: I NEED CONCISION, AND ALSO SIMPLICITY.

For example, when designing a shape, such as a heart, it's better to use an accurate representation rather than relying on simplified forms like the cardioid. But cardioid is also acceptable.
Above is just an example.JUST EXAMPLE,NOT THE TASK DESIGNING.
So,  you can design it yourself:def shape_curve(t) or use simple ones, just make sure it is simple and precise.
Ensure the curve accurately represents the shape, avoiding sharp turns whenever possible.

Important:Because latter I will sample keyframes from the curve you designed, I prefers to keep curves simple while maintaining precision to ensure that sampled keyframes can effectively represent the original shape. I want to avoid complexity that could make sampled points less representative of the shape.
For example, if a spiral shape is required, ensure it doesn't create too many loops—only two or three circles may be enough.

User: **Task:** Generate keyframes of a continuous trajectory to represent a specified shape. It's a trajectory for a human, and sharp turns should be avoided.

### **Step 0 :use 1~2 sentences to describe the curve that form the shape we want.
for example, when it comes to heart shape, it should feature a smooth, continuous curve, with a gentle peak at the top and a rounded bottom, avoiding any sharp angles.
Above is just an example of how to describe the curve.JUST EXAMPLE,NOT THE TASK DESCRIPTION.
### **Step 1 : Define the shape/curve using precise parametric equations or mathematical functions.**

REMEMBER: I NEED CONCISION, AND ALSO SIMPLICITY.

For example, when designing a shape, such as a heart, it's better to use an accurate representation rather than relying on simplified forms like the cardioid. But cardioid is also acceptable.
Above is just an example.JUST EXAMPLE,NOT THE TASK DESIGNING.
So,  you can design it yourself:def shape_curve(t) or use simple ones, just make sure it is simple and precise.
Ensure the curve accurately represents the shape, avoiding sharp turns whenever possible.

Important:Because latter I will sample keyframes from the curve you designed, I prefers to keep curves simple while maintaining precision to ensure that sampled keyframes can effectively represent the original shape. I want to avoid complexity that could make sampled points less representative of the shape.
For example, if a spiral shape is required, ensure it doesn't create too many loops—only two or three circles may be enough.
AGAIN: Above is just an example to show that you pay attention to simplicity.

Model: 1. Analysis of the curve:
   - The shape is a capital 'S', which consists of two distinct parts.
     - The upper part can be represented by a cubic Bezier curve.
     - The lower part can be represented by another cubic Bezier curve.
   - Together, these two segments form a continuous, smooth trajectory resembling the letter 'S'.

give me def shape_curve(t)
Model: **Analysis:**

The given description "walk forward, then turn right, and walk forward again, then turn left" suggests a shape that is not a closed trajectory. It can be broken down into three segments:

1. Walk forward (a straight line).
2. Turn right and walk forward (another straight line at a right angle to the first).
3. Turn left and walk forward (a straight line parallel to the first one, but offset).

This could represent an 'L' or a stepwise pattern which is inherently an open trajectory.

我想画出一个Description = "Walk forward, then turn right, and walk forward again, then turn (towards 10 o'clock) and continue walking ."
give me def shape_curve(t)
Model: Analysis of the curve/line/shape (trajectory):

- This description suggests a piecewise linear path.
- The trajectory starts with a straight segment (walking forward).
- It then makes a right turn (usually 90 degrees) and continues straight.
- Finally, it turns towards the 10 o'clock direction (assuming 30 degrees left from the original direction, based on the standard clock face divisions) and continues straight.

To model this piecewise linear path, we can use parametric equations for each segment and appropriately switch between them based on the range of the parameter \( t \).

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    if 0 <= t < 1:
        # Walk forward (segment 1)
        x = t
        y = 0
    elif 1 <= t < 2:
        # Turn right and walk forward (segment 2)
        x = 1
        y = t - 1
    elif 2 <= t <= 3:
        # Turn towards 10 o'clock direction (30 degrees left from the original direction) and continue walking (segment 3)
        angle = np.deg2rad(30)  # 30 degrees in radians
        x = 1 + (t - 2) * np.cos(angle)

Now the input is:

我想画出一个Description = "Walk forward, then turn around and walk forward again, then turn (towards 10 o'clock) and continue walking ."
give me def shape_curve(t)
Model: Based on the description "Walk forward, then turn around and walk forward again, then turn (towards 10 o'clock) and continue walking," the trajectory can be broken down into the following segments:

1. Walk forward: This indicates a straight line in one direction.
2. Turn around and walk forward again: This means walking straight back in the direction we came from.
3. Turn towards 10 o'clock and continue walking: Based on the clock directions, this means a change in angle to approximately 300 degrees (when considering 0 degrees as straight forward).

To create this trajectory, I will design a continuous function that respects these steps. 

Here is the Python code that captures this trajectory:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    if t < 1:
        # First segment: walking forward along the positive y-axis
        x = 0
        y = 10 * t
    elif t < 2:
        # Second segment: walking back the same distance, negative y-axis
        x = 0
        y = 10 * (2 - t)
    else:
        # Third segment: turning towards 10 o'clock and continue walking
        angle = np.deg2rad(300)  # converting 300 degrees to radians
        distance = 10 * (t - 2)
        x = distance * np.cos(angle)
        y = (10 - distance * np.sin(angle))
    
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
t_range = (0, 3)
```

Explanation:
1. For \(0 \leq t < 1\): The person walks forward along the y-axis. The distance covered is proportional to \(t\), resulting in coordinates \((x = 0, y = 10t)\).
2. For \(1 \leq t < 2\): The person turns around and walks back, resulting in \((x = 0, y = 10(2 - t))\).
3. For \(t \geq 2\): The person turns to 10 o'clock and continues walking. The turning angle is 300 degrees from the straight line forward, providing coordinates \((x = distance \cos(300^\circ), y = 10 - distance \sin(300^\circ))\).

This code will produce the continuous trajectory as per the description provided.

Now the input is:

我想画出一个Description = "Walk forward, then turn around and walk forward again, then turn (towards 10 o'clock) and continue walking ."
give me def shape_curve(t)
Model: To analyze the given trajectory from the description:

1. **Walk forward** - This will be a straight line in one direction.
2. **Turn around and walk forward again** - This implies walking back over the path you just came from, which gives overlapping and creates a trajectory that depends on time.
3. **Turn (towards 10 o'clock) and continue walking** - This means a change in direction by a certain angle, specifically towards a direction slightly to the left front, which can be approximated as 30 degrees less than 90 degrees (i.e. 60 degrees from the straight-ahead direction).

The trajectory will not be a closed curve. It starts from the origin, moves forward, comes back to the origin (overlapping the initial path depending on time), and then turns and continues at a new angle.

Here, we can break the trajectory into three parts:
- The initial walk forward.
- The reverse walk back to origin.
- The turn and walk forward in the new direction.

Let's define the suitable mathematical functions for these parts:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t): 
    if t < 1.0:
        # Walk forward (first segment)
        x = 10 * t
        y = 0
    elif t < 2.0:
        # Turn around and walk forward again (second segment, effectively reverse)
        x = 10 * (2 - t)
        y = 0
    else:
        # Walk towards 10 o'clock (third segment)
        t_adjusted = t - 2.0
        angle = np.radians(60)  # 60 degrees from the straight direction
        x = -10 * np.cos(angle) + 10 * t_adjusted * np.cos(angle)
        y = 10 * t_adjusted * np.sin(angle)
        
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
t_range = (0.0, 3.0)
```

Explanation:
1. For \(0 \leq t < 1\), the trajectory is straight ahead along the x-axis.
2. For \(1 \leq t < 2\), the trajectory turns around and comes back along the same path, overlapping.
3. For \(t \geq 2\), the trajectory turns to the new angle (10 o'clock direction which is 60 degrees from the initial straight-ahead direction).

The range of \(t\) chosen is from 0 to 3 to cover all the mentioned segments.

Otherwise, it needs to be designed as a closed trajectory, for example, a closed geometric figure, "walk around,"... In conclusion, you should decide by yourself.
2. Extract the curve/line/shape(trajectory) from the action description. The input is an action description, and you need to extract the human movement trajectory from it. If there are phrases like "turn around," indicating that the curve has overlapping parts, you need to consider this as well (this is not a normal two-dimensional curve but a three-dimensional curve related to time). In some cases, the parameter `t` in the `shape_curve(t)` function represents time.
3. Analysis of the curve/line/shape(trajectory). You need to analyze the trajectory first, instead of directly designing the code. (Thinking is important)

Now the input is:

I want to draw a Description = "Walk forward, then turn around and walk forward again, then turn (towards 10 o'clock) and continue walking ."
give me def shape_curve(t)
Model: To turn the description into a mathematical function representing the person's movement trajectory, let's first break down the steps:

1. **Walk forward**: Starting at (0,0), walking forward means moving along the y-axis in the positive direction.
2. **Turn around and walk forward again**: A 180-degree turn will reverse the direction and the person will walk in the negative y-direction.
3. **Turn towards 10 o'clock**: This means turning approximately 45 degrees to the left from the backward direction (which is now facing the negative y-axis) and continuing to walk in that new direction.

Now let's define each section of the trajectory mathematically.
- For simplicity, let's assume each segment (forward, backward, and 10 o'clock direction) takes equal time.

The curve will be parametrized by time \( t \):
- From \( t = 0 \) to \( t = 1 \): Moving forward along positive y-axis.
- From \( t = 1 \) to \( t = 2 \): Turning around and moving backward along negative y-axis.
- From \( t = 2 \) to \( t = 3 \): Turning ~45 degrees towards 10 o'clock direction.

Let's start defining the function.

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    if 0 <= t < 1:
        # Walk forward
        x = 0
        y = t
    elif 1 <= t < 2:
        # Turn around and walk forward (which is actually walking backward from the original direction)
        x = 0
        y = 1 - (t - 1)
    elif 2 <= t <= 3:
        # Turn towards 10 o'clock and continue walking
        # New direction implies a rotation of 135 degrees counterclockwise from the positive y-axis
        x = -(t - 2) * (2 ** 0.5 / 2)  # sin(135 degrees) = sqrt(2)/2
        y = -(t - 2) * (2 ** 0.5 / 2)
    
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t 
t_range = (0, 3)
```

In this function:
- From \( t = 0 \) to \( t = 1 \): The person walks forward along the y-axis.
- From \( t = 1 \) to \( t = 2 \): The person turns around and walks back.
- From \( t = 2 \) to \( t = 3 \): The person turns and walks towards 10 o'clock direction.

This function reflects the described trajectory accurately.

User: **Task:** draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:
1. You need to decide if it's a closed trajectory, and if it's not a closed curve (for example, the capital letter 'S', 'L', 'N', 'M', ...), then don't design the function as a closed curve. Otherwise, it needs to be designed as a closed trajectory, for example, a closed geometric figure, "walk around,"... In conclusion, you should decide by yourself.
2. Extract the curve/line/shape(trajectory) from the action description. The input is an action description, and you need to extract the human movement trajectory from it. If there are phrases like "turn around," indicating that the curve has overlapping parts, you need to consider this as well (this is not a normal two-dimensional curve but a three-dimensional curve related to time). In some cases, the parameter `t` in the `shape_curve(t)` function represents time.
3. Analysis of the curve/line/shape(trajectory). You need to analyze the trajectory first, instead of directly designing the code. (Thinking is important)
4. Mathematical functions: ONLY BE PRESENTED IN THE FORM BELOW IN THE CODE BLOCK (`python`).

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CODE IS CORRECT AND CAN RUN WITHOUT ERROR.
YOUR CODE SHOULD BE PRESENTED EXACTLY IN THE FORM BELOW:

```python
def shape_curve(t): # The curve starts at (0,0)
    ...
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (start_value, end_value)
```

Now the input is:

I want to draw a Description = "Walk forward, then turn around and walk forward again, then turn (towards 10 o'clock) and continue walking ."
give me def shape_curve(t)
Model: To create the trajectory for the given action description, let's break it down into parts:

1. Start at (0, 0).
2. Walk forward (straight ahead).
3. Turn around and walk forward again (now heading in the opposite direction).
4. Turn towards the 10 o'clock direction (which means a slightly to the left front, a little more than 45 degrees) and continue walking.

Analyzing the steps:
- The first segment is a straight line.
- The second segment is also a straight line but in the opposite direction.
- The third segment changes direction slightly to the left (10 o'clock) and continues forward.

Let's assume the person walks a unit distance in each segment for simplicity. We will define a parametric function where \( t \) parameterizes the trajectory over different segments.

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    if t < 1:  # First segment
        x = t * 1
        y = 0
    elif t < 2:  # Second segment
        t_adjusted = t - 1
        x = 1 - t_adjusted * 1
        y = 0
    else:  # Third segment with a slight turn towards 10 o'clock direction
        t_adjusted = t - 2
        angle = np.radians(135)  # 10 o'clock is 135 degrees from the forward direction
        x = -1 + t_adjusted * np.cos(angle)
        y = t_adjusted * np.sin(angle)
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (from 0 to 3 for three segments)
t_range = (0, 3)
```

This code:
- Defines the trajectory based on the given description.
- The `shape_curve(t)` function encapsulates the parametric equation.
- `t_range` specifies the interval over which the function is defined.

You can plot it to visualize the trajectory:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
t_values = np.linspace(t_range[0], t_range[1], 300)
points = [shape_curve(t) for t in t_values]
x_values, y_values = zip(*points)

plt.plot(x_values, y_values)
plt.xlabel('X-axis')
plt.ylabel('Y-axis')
plt.title('Trajectory of Walk')
plt.grid(True)
plt.axis('equal')
plt.show()
```

This will show the continuous trajectory plotting the movements according to the provided description.

I want to draw a Description = "Walk forward, and turn (towards 10 o'clock) and continue walking , then turn (towards 10 o'clock) and continue walking ."
give me def shape_curve(t)
Model: ### Analysis

1. **Trajectory Analysis:**
   - The trajectory starts with walking forward (straight line).
   - Makes the first turn towards 10 o'clock and continues walking in that direction which typically means a slightly left turn (let's assume 45-degree turn for easier computation).
   - Makes another turn towards 10 o'clock and continues walking in that direction, essentially making another turn at a 45-degree angle to the previous direction.

2. **Trajectory Nature:**
   - This is not a closed trajectory.
   - We have two turns at 10 o'clock (45 degrees).

### Mathematical Formulation

The path can be divided into three segments:
- **Segment 1:** Walk forward in a straight line.
- **Segment 2:** Turn 45 degrees to the left (10 o'clock direction) and continue walking.
- **Segment 3:** Turn 45 degrees to the left again from the new direction and walk forward.

Using parameters and equations for each segment, the total trajectory can be described continuously with different equations for different time intervals.

### Code Implementation

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Segment 1: Walk forward
    if 0 <= t < 1:
        x = t
        y = 0
    
    # Segment 2: Turn towards 10 o'clock and continue
    elif 1 <= t < 2:
        angle = np.pi / 4  # 45 degrees in radians
        x = 1 + np.cos(angle) * (t - 1)
        y = np.sin(angle) * (t - 1)
    
    # Segment 3: Turn towards 10 o'clock again and continue
    elif 2 <= t <= 3:
        angle_double = np.pi / 2  # 90 degrees in radians after two 45 degree turns
        x = 1 + np.cos(np.pi / 4) + np.cos(angle_double) * (t - 2)
        y = np.sin(np.pi / 4) + np.sin(angle_double) * (t - 2)
    
    else:
        raise ValueError("t out of range")
    
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 3)
```

Here the code divides the parameter `t` into three segments (0-1 for straight walk, 1-2 for the first turn, and 2-3 for the second turn). The respective equations are applied to obtain `(x, y)` values for each segment.

2. Extract the curve/line/shape(trajectory) from the action description. The input is an action description, and you need to extract the human movement trajectory from it. If there are phrases like "turn around," indicating that the curve has overlapping parts, you need to consider this as well (this is not a normal two-dimensional curve but a three-dimensional curve related to time). In some cases, the parameter `t` in the `shape_curve(t)` function represents time.
3. Analysis of the curve/line/shape(trajectory). You need to analyze the trajectory first, instead of directly designing the code. (Thinking is important)
4. Mathematical functions: ONLY BE PRESENTED IN THE FORM BELOW IN THE CODE BLOCK (`python`).

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CODE IS CORRECT AND CAN RUN WITHOUT ERROR.
YOUR CODE SHOULD BE PRESENTED EXACTLY IN THE FORM BELOW:

```python
def shape_curve(t): # The curve starts at (0,0)
    ...
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (start_value, end_value)
```

**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

4. **Mathematical Functions:** Present the final code strictly in the form provided below, ensuring it is correct and can run without errors.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.

**Code Format:**
```python
def shape_curve(t): # The curve starts at (0,0)
    ...
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (start_value, end_value)
```

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Perform a U-turn.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: Based on the description, "Perform a U-turn," we need to create a function that describes the trajectory of a U-turn. A U-turn typically is an open trajectory as it starts from one point and curves back in the opposite direction.

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- The U-turn can be approached as a semicircle, where the person starts at one point, follows a half-circle path, and ends on the opposite side.

Here's the code to achieve this:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t): # The curve starts at (0,0)
    # Assuming a semicircle of radius 1 unit for a simple U-turn
    radius = 1.0
    angle = np.pi * t  # t ranges from 0 to 1, sweeping angle from 0 to pi
    x = radius * np.cos(angle)
    y = radius * np.sin(angle)
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 1)
```

This code snippet creates a U-turn trajectory using a semicircle with a unit radius. The angle changes uniformly from 0 to π as `t` goes from 0 to 1, providing a smooth, continuous path.
extracted_code: import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t): # The curve starts at (0,0)
    # Assuming a semicircle of radius 1 unit for a simple U-turn
    radius = 1.0

    x = radius * np.cos(angle)
    y = radius * np.sin(angle)
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 1)

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Perform a dance.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To determine whether the trajectory of "Perform a dance" is closed or open, we need to consider typical dance movements. Dance routines often involve repeating moves and patterns that may lead to a closed trajectory. For simplicity and clarity, let's consider a basic dance routine that results in a closed trajectory.

Since "perform a dance" is a bit vague, we will create a simple yet representative dance pattern trajectory. Let's assume this involves some basic steps like moving forward, to the side, and turning.

Here is the breakdown of the trajectory:
1. Move forward for 2 meters.
2. Turn 90 degrees right, and move sideways for 2 meters.
3. Turn 90 degrees right, and move backward for 2 meters.
4. Turn 90 degrees right, and move sideways for 2 meters.

This creates a basic square dance pattern which is a closed trajectory.

Now let's convert this trajectory into the required code:

```python
import math

def shape_curve(t): # The curve starts at (0,0)
    # Normalizing t to a range of 0 to 4 for our 4-step dance.
    step = t % 4
    
    if step < 1:
        x = t * 2
        y = 0
    elif step < 2:
        x = 2
        y = (t - 1) * 2
    elif step < 3:
        x = 2 - (t - 2) * 2
        y = 2
    else:
        x = 0
        y = 2 - (t - 3) * 2
    
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (important). Let's assume a full cycle is from t = 0 to t = 4.
t_range = (0, 4)
```

This basic code represents a square-dance pattern which is closed. As the variable `t` progresses, it follows a path that repeatedly travels around a square. This simple example is a good starting point for representing a dance trajectory.
extracted_code: import math

def shape_curve(t): # The curve starts at (0,0)
    # Normalizing t to a range of 0 to 4 for our 4-step dance.

    if step < 1:
        x = t * 2
        y = 0
    elif step < 2:
        x = 2
        y = (t - 1) * 2
    elif step < 3:

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Navigate through a crowded room.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Open

**Trajectory Analysis:**
Navigating through a crowded room is an open trajectory where the person's movement can be quite arbitrary and variable. For simplification, let's represent the person's trajectory as a winding path with turns and straight sections to mimic moving around obstacles in a room.

**Mathematical Functions:**
We'll represent this trajectory with a series of linear and sine/cosine segments to approximate the winding path through the room.

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t): # The curve starts at (0,0)
    if 0 <= t < 1:
        x = 5 * t
        y = np.sin(5 * np.pi * t)
    elif 1 <= t < 2:
        x = 5 + 5 * (t - 1) * np.cos(np.pi / 4)
        y = np.sin(5 * np.pi) + 5 * (t - 1) * np.sin(np.pi / 4)
    elif 2 <= t < 3:
        x = 5 + 5 * np.cos(np.pi / 4) + 5 * (t - 2) * np.cos(np.pi / 3)
        y = np.sin(5 * np.pi) + 5 * np.sin(np.pi / 4) + 5 * (t - 2) * np.sin(np.pi / 3)
    else:
        x = 0
        y = 0    
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 3)
```

Explanation:
- We divided the trajectory into three segments with different behaviors to simulate moving through a crowded room:
  1. First segment (0 <= t < 1): The person moves forward while slightly oscillating horizontally, simulating side-stepping.
  2. Second segment (1 <= t < 2): The person changes direction at an angle (45 degrees) and continues straight, simulating a turn around an object.
  3. Third segment (2 <= t < 3): Another change in direction at a different angle (60 degrees), to represent more obstacle navigation.

The `t_range` is set from 0 to 3 to cover the duration of the described movement.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Draw a complex geometric shape.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To draw a complex geometric shape, we’ll first need to determine whether the trajectory is closed or open. Since it’s described as a "complex geometric shape," we will assume it is a closed trajectory.

Given the general nature of the request, I'll interpret a complex geometric shape as a star with five points. This is a commonly recognized complex shape that will appropriately represent the complexity implied.

Let's go through the steps required:

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:**
   The trajectory is **closed**, as it’s a geometric shape.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
   - Start at the top point.
   - Draw lines to create a star with 5 points.
   - The star should be centered at origin (0,0).

3. **Trajectory Analysis:**
   We need to evenly distribute points on a circle and connect them in a star pattern. For simplicity, we’ll use parametric polar coordinates. We will convert these points into Cartesian coordinates.

Below is the code strictly in the requested format. It defines a parametric function to describe a star shape centered at the origin.

```python
import math

def shape_curve(t): # The curve starts at (0,0)
    # Number of star points.
    num_points = 5
    # Outer radius of the star points
    outer_radius = 1
    # Inner radius of the star (to form the points)
    inner_radius = outer_radius * math.sin(math.pi / (2 * num_points)) / math.sin(math.pi * ((num_points - 1) / (2 * num_points)))
    
    # Calculate the angle
    theta = 2 * math.pi * t
    
    # Determine if we are on an outer or inner point
    if int(t * num_points) % 2 == 0:
        radius = outer_radius
    else:
        radius = inner_radius
    
    # Convert polar to Cartesian coordinates
    x = radius * math.cos(theta)
    y = radius * math.sin(theta)
    
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 1)
```

In this code:
- `num_points` is set to 5 to create a 5-pointed star.
- `outer_radius` represents how far from the center the outer points of the star are.
- `inner_radius` is calculated to find a visually appealing inner distance between points of the star.

The parameter `t` ranges from 0 to 1, mapping to a full rotation around the star. The function `math.pi * t` generates a circle's radians for the points, and the conditional logic ensures alternating between outer and inner points to draw the star correctly.

    # Calculate the angle
    theta = 2 * math.pi * t
    
    # Determine if we are on an outer or inner point
    if int(t * num_points) % 2 == 0:
        radius = outer_radius
    else:
        radius = inner_radius
    
    # Convert polar to Cartesian coordinates
    x = radius * math.cos(theta)
    y = radius * math.sin(theta)
    
    return x, y

**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

4. **Mathematical Functions:** Present the final code strictly in the form provided below, ensuring it is correct and can run without errors.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.

**Code Format:**
```python
def shape_curve(t): # The curve starts at (0,0)
    ...
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (start_value, end_value)
```

---

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Walk through a forest.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: Based on the provided description "Walk through a forest," the trajectory isn't clearly defined in terms of specific geometric shapes or distinct steps, making an exact path difficult to determine. However, I will interpret this as a random, winding path to mimic walking through a forest.

### Considerations
1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory is open since it's just walking through a forest, not returning to the starting point in a loop.

2. The trajectory is complex or vague, so I will skip providing the fixed format breakdown.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Since the description is vague, I'll create a simple and smooth winding path using trigonometric functions to simulate the randomness of walking through a forest.

### Implementation
The randomness can be simulated by using a combined sine and cosine function to create a winding path. We'll assume `t` ranges from `0` to `2*pi` to keep it simple.

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t): # The curve starts at (0,0)
    x = t * np.cos(t)
    y = t * np.sin(t)
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
t_range = (0, 2 * np.pi)
```

This code represents a winding path that could resemble a person walking through a forest with a variable path created by sine and cosine functions. The range of `t` from `0` to `2*pi` ensures we have a smooth trajectory. 

Adjust `t_range` and the formula for `x` and `y` to better simulate different walking paths or increase complexity if needed.
extracted_code: import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t): # The curve starts at (0,0)
    x = t * np.cos(t)
    y = t * np.sin(t)
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t

"I want to draw a Description = 'Play a game of tennis.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To create a trajectory for playing a game of tennis, we need to consider the movements involved, such as serving, moving side to side, and approaching the net. This will be a simplified representation as an actual tennis game involves complex and dynamic movements.

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** 
   The trajectory for playing tennis can be complex and involves movement in a specific area (tennis court), making this a semi-closed trajectory but simpler than a true closed loop. For this case, we treat it as an open trajectory while simplifying the general movements in a tennis court.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
   - Start at the center of the baseline.
   - Move sideways (left and right) simulating baseline rallies.
   - Approach the net and move sideways near the net.
   - Move back to the baseline.

--- (simplified representation) ---
3. **Trajectory Analysis:**
   - The player starts at one point, moves to the sides simulating rallies, then approaches the net, and moves side-to-side near the net and finally moves back.
   - This will be simplified into linear movements in a 2D plane.

4. **Mathematical Functions:**
```python
def shape_curve(t): # The curve starts at (0,0)
    if 0 <= t < 2:
        # Move sideways left (0,0) to (-3,0)
        x = -3 * t / 2
        y = 0
    elif 2 <= t < 4:
        # Move sideways right (-3,0) to (3,0)
        x = -3 + 3 * (t - 2) / 2
        y = 0
    elif 4 <= t < 6:
        # Move towards the net (3,0) to (3,3)
        x = 3
        y = 3 * (t - 4) / 2
    elif 6 <= t < 8:
        # Move sideways near net (3,3) to (0,3)
        x = 3 - 3 * (t - 6) / 2
        y = 3
    elif 8 <= t < 10:
        # Move back to baseline (0,3) to (0,0)
        x = 0
        y = 3 - 3 * (t - 8) / 2

        y = 0  # Return to the start if t is outside expected range
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 10)
```

In the above code:
- The specified range of `t` ranges from 0 to 10 to represent a single sequence of movements.
- Linear interpolation is used to model movements.
- Adjustments would be required for more complex and realistic trajectories.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Climb a mountain.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: 1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:**
   - This trajectory is open. Climbing a mountain usually involves starting at the base and moving towards the peak without returning to the start point in a continuous path.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:**
   - To represent climbing a mountain, we can assume a non-linear path that starts at the base (0,0) and moves upwards. To simulate climbing, we can use an increasing function for both x and y, such as a logarithmic curve which increases steeply at first and then gradually flattens.

Here's how we can represent this in a mathematical function:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t): # The curve starts at (0,0)
    x = t
    y = np.log(1 + t)
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 10)
```

In this code:
- `x = t` represents the horizontal distance traveled.
- `y = np.log(1 + t)` represents the vertical ascent, which starts steep and gradually flattens, simulating the effort required to climb a mountain.

**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

4. **Mathematical Functions:** Present the final code strictly in the form provided below, ensuring it is correct and can run without errors.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.

**Code Format:**
```python
def shape_curve(t): # The curve starts at (0,0)
    ...
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (start_value, end_value)
```

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Do a martial arts routine.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: ### Analysis and Decision:

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:**
   Given that a martial arts routine often involves returning to an initial position or stance, it is likely a **closed trajectory**. However, the specific routine could vary a lot, leading to potential complexity and specifics in the paths.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
   Since a martial arts routine can involve many complex movements, here is a simplified version of a possible routine, broken down into four main moves:
   1. Move forward 5 meters.
   2. Turn 90 degrees to the left and move 5 meters.
   3. Turn 90 degrees to the left and move 5 meters.
   4. Turn 90 degrees to the left and move 5 meters back to the start.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:**
   Considering the simplified breakdown, the trajectory forms a square which ensures the description stays clear and executable within the specified code format.

4. **Mathematical Functions:**
   - The moves correspond to linear segments in the XY plane.
   - Linear segments ensure uniform speed.
   - The parameter `t` will represent time, progressing uniformly.

Here's the simplified implementation:

```python
def shape_curve(t): # The curve starts at (0,0)
    # Define the segments for a square trace as the martial arts routine
    if 0 <= t < 1:
        x = 5 * t
        y = 0
    elif 1 <= t < 2:
        x = 5
        y = 5 * (t - 1)
    elif 2 <= t < 3:
        x = 5 - 5 * (t - 2)
        y = 5
    elif 3 <= t <= 4:
        x = 0
        y = 5 - 5 * (t - 3)
    else:
        x = 0
        y = 0
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 4)
```

### Explanation:
- **Segments Division:**
  - \( t \) ranges from 0 to 4 (4 segments).
  - Each segment represents 1 unit of time.
- **Segment 1:** Moves horizontally to the right.
- **Segment 2:** Moves vertically upwards.
- **Segment 3:** Moves horizontally to the left.
- **Segment 4:** Moves vertically downwards back to the starting point.

Each segment is parameterized for `t` ensuring a uniform progression within the allotted time range `t_range = (0, 4)`.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Move like a robot.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To create a trajectory based on the description "Move like a robot," we need to interpret what a robotic movement might look like. Typically, robotic movements are characterized by precise, angular, and segmented paths. For simplicity, I will consider the trajectory as a series of straight line segments and right-angle turns, much like the kind of path a very basic robot might follow.

**Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory described as "Move like a robot" implies a series of movements that do not necessarily form a closed loop. Therefore, I will consider it an **open trajectory**.

**Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
1. Move forward for a specified distance.
2. Turn 90 degrees right and move forward.
3. Turn 90 degrees left and move forward.
4. Repeat the pattern to extend the trajectory.

**Trajectory Analysis:**
Since the pattern implies a mixture of right and left turns, we will alternate between these movements. For simplicity, we will assume equal distances between the turns.

Based on this interpretation, below is the mathematical representation of the trajectory:

```python
def shape_curve(t): # The curve starts at (0,0)
    import math
    segment_length = 1  # Length of each straight segment
    num_segments = int(t)  # Total completed segments within time t

    x, y = 0, 0  # Starting coordinates
    direction = 0  # Start facing along the positive x-axis (0 radians)

    for i in range(num_segments):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            # Move forward in the current direction
            x += segment_length * math.cos(direction)
            y += segment_length * math.sin(direction)
            # Turn 90 degrees right
            direction -= math.pi / 2
        else:
            # Move forward in the current direction
            x += segment_length * math.cos(direction)
            y += segment_length * math.sin(direction)
            # Turn 90 degrees left
            direction += math.pi / 2

    # Partial segment movement for fractional t
    remaining_t = t - num_segments
    x += remaining_t * segment_length * math.cos(direction)
    y += remaining_t * segment_length * math.sin(direction)

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 10)
```

This code creates an open trajectory that mimics a robotic path using straight-line segments and alternating 90-degree turns. The function `shape_curve(t)` calculates the `(x, y)` coordinates based on the parameter `t`, which can be interpreted as time or steps.


extracted_code: def shape_curve(t): # The curve starts at (0,0)

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Recreate a famous painting.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To recreate a famous painting, we'll need to decide on a specific painting and analyze its features. For simplicity, let's choose Leonardo da Vinci's "Mona Lisa," which, when reduced to a very simplistic form, can be perceived as an oval.

Given this context, we'll consider the trajectory of drawing an oval, which is a simple closed trajectory. We will represent this with an oval parametric equation. 

This choice assumes that the trajectory primarily follows an oval path. Still, note that a real recreation of such a painting would be immensely complex, involving intricate detailing beyond the scope of this task.

### Closed or Open Trajectory:
Closed

### Trajectory Analysis:
We can represent the oval using the standard parametric form of an ellipse:
\[ x(t) = a \cos(t) \]
\[ y(t) = b \sin(t) \]
Where \( a \) is half of the width (horizontal radius), and \( b \) is half of the height (vertical radius) of the oval. We'll assume arbitrary values of \( a \) and \( b \) for this.

### Mathematical Functions
Given the nature of the oval and the requirement for uniform motion, we can write the following code:

```python
import math

def shape_curve(t): # The curve starts at (0,0)
    # Parameters representing the oval size
    a = 1.0  # Horizontal radius
    b = 1.5  # Vertical radius
    
    # Parametric equations for an oval
    x = a * math.cos(t)
    y = b * math.sin(t)
    
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (0 to 2 * pi for a full lap)
t_range = (0, 2 * math.pi)
```

### Execution Explanation
- The function `shape_curve(t)` takes a parameter `t` which would typically denote time or another continuous parameter.
- It returns coordinates `(x, y)` based on the parametric equations of an oval.
- The range of `t` is from \( 0 \) to \( 2\pi \), which completes a full traversal of the oval.

This code draws a simplified representation of an oval, which is a basic element of many classical paintings, fitting the description of creating a famous painting in a minimalistic sense. For recreating actual famous paintings with detailed fidelity, advanced and more complex algorithms would be needed.

def shape_curve(t): # The curve starts at (0,0)

**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

4. **Mathematical Functions:** Present the final code strictly in the form provided below, ensuring it is correct and can run without errors.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.

**Code Format:**
```python
def shape_curve(t): # The curve starts at (0,0)
    ...
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (start_value, end_value)
```

---

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Travel from one side of the city to the other.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: ### Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:
The trajectory described as "Travel from one side of the city to the other" is an open trajectory because it is a journey from a starting point to a different endpoint without returning to the start.

### Trajectory Analysis:
For simplicity, let's assume that this description refers to a straight path across the city. This means, we move in a straight line from the starting point (0, 0) to some endpoint (let's say, (1, 1) for simplicity in a normalized manner).

### Code:
```python
def shape_curve(t): # The curve starts at (0,0)
    x = t
    y = t
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 1)
```

In this code, `t` ranges from 0 to 1, meaning the person travels linearly from the starting point (0, 0) to the endpoint (1, 1). This represents a straight-line journey across the city from one side to the other.
extracted_code: def shape_curve(t): # The curve starts at (0,0)

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Walk through a forest.'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To draw a trajectory for "Walk through a forest," we first need to decide if the trajectory is closed or open. Given that it is about simply walking through a forest, which typically implies a path rather than a loop, the trajectory is likely open.

Since the description is too vague, let's extract a general path trajectory with some gentle turns and variations.

### Trajectory Analysis:

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Open

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
   - Walk forward for 10 meters.
   - Turn 45 degrees right.
   - Walk forward for 7 meters.
   - Turn 90 degrees left.
   - Walk forward for 5 meters.
   - Turn 45 degrees right.
   - Walk forward for 8 meters.
   
   Note: In a real forest, paths could be much more complex and natural. This is just a simple example.

Given this breakdown, we can generate a smooth and continuous function to represent these movements.

### Code:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    if t <= 10:
        x = t
        y = 0
    elif t <= 17:
        x = 10 + (t-10) * np.cos(np.radians(45))
        y = (t-10) * np.sin(np.radians(45))
    elif t <= 22:
        x = 10 + 7 * np.cos(np.radians(45)) + (t-17) * np.cos(np.radians(-45))
        y = 7 * np.sin(np.radians(45)) + (t-17) * np.sin(np.radians(-45))
    elif t <= 30:
        x = 10 + 7 * np.cos(np.radians(45)) + 5 * np.cos(np.radians(-45)) + (t-22) * np.cos(np.radians(0))
        y = 7 * np.sin(np.radians(45)) + 5 * np.sin(np.radians(-45)) + (t-22) * np.sin(np.radians(0))
    else:
        x = 10 + 7 * np.cos(np.radians(45)) + 5 * np.cos(np.radians(-45)) + 8 * np.cos(np.radians(0)) + (t-30) * np.cos(np.radians(45))
        y = 7 * np.sin(np.radians(45)) + 5 * np.sin(np.radians(-45)) + 8 * np.sin(np.radians(0)) + (t-30) * np.sin(np.radians(45))
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 38)
```

### Explanation:

- **Segment 1 (0 <= t <= 10):** Walking straight for 10 meters.
- **Segment 2 (10 < t <= 17):** Turning 45 degrees to the right and walking 7 meters.
- **Segment 3 (17 < t <= 22):** Turning 90 degrees to the left (resulting in an angle that effectively negates the right turn) and walking 5 meters.
- **Segment 4 (22 < t <= 30):** Continuing straight after the left 90-degree turn for 8 meters.
- **Segment 5 (30 < t):** Turning 45 degrees right and continuing for an undefined length (to indicate this is an open path).

This function provides a smooth continuous path as specified. Adjustments can be made based on specific details if the forest path description becomes more detailed.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Walk forward, then turn around and walk forward again, then turn (towards 10 o'clock) and continue walking .'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: Given the description, let's break it down and create a smooth trajectory for it:

**Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Open

**Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**

1. Walk straight forward.
2. Turn around (180 degrees) and walk forward again.
3. Turn left towards the 10 o'clock direction (120 degrees to the left from the current heading) and continue walking.

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- The person starts walking in a straight line.
- Then they turn 180 degrees and retrace their path.
- Finally, they turn 120 degrees to the left and continue walking in a new direction.

We'll model this with three sequential segments.

Here's the code to generate the described trajectory:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    if t <= 1/3:
        # First segment: walk straight forward
        x = t * 3
        y = 0
    elif t <= 2/3:
        # Second segment: turn around and walk forward again
        t = t - 1/3
        x = (1 - t) * 3
        y = 0
    else:
        # Third segment: turn left towards 10 o'clock and continue walking
        t = t - 2/3
        x = np.cos(np.radians(120)) * (t * 3) + 1
        y = np.sin(np.radians(120)) * (t * 3)
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
t_range = (0, 1)
```

Explanation of the code:
1. **First segment:** `0 <= t <= 1/3`
   - The person walks straight forward from `(0, 0)` to `(3, 0)`.
   - `x = t * 3`, `y = 0`.

2. **Second segment:** `1/3 < t <= 2/3`
   - The person turns around and retraces the path back to `(0, 0)`.
   - `x = (1 - t) * 3`, `y = 0`.

3. **Third segment:** `2/3 < t <= 1`
   - The person turns towards 10 o'clock (120 degrees to the left) and continues walking.
   - Using polar to Cartesian transformation, `(t * 3)` scaled by cosine and sine of `120 degrees`.
   - New origin is at `(1, 0)` due to the backward walk: `x = np.cos(np.radians(120)) * (t * 3) + 1`, `y = np.sin(np.radians(120)) * (t * 3)`.

The trajectory smoothly transitions between segments and maintains uniform speed.

User (Follow-up): Great Job. Now I get the keyframes of 30 points, but I only want to choose 6~14 points from them.

PAY ATTENTION: The points must be numbered and chosen in sequential order, not randomly.
Ensuring the points follow the curve's natural path.
IN ORDER & along the curve is important
Increase point density at critical or sharp turns to smooth the trajectory. For you only need to choose 6~14 points out of 30, you should pay more attention to the critical or sharp turns.

**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

4. **Mathematical Functions:** Present the final code strictly in the form provided below, ensuring it is correct and can run without errors.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.
再次强调：为了确保平滑过渡，您需要调整每一段段的公式，使其从上一段的终点坐标开始，而不是独立地重新定义 x 和 y。

"I want to draw a Description = 'Walk forward, then turn around and walk forward again, then turn (towards 10 o'clock) and continue walking .'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Based on the provided description, the trajectory is open because it involves walking in a specific direction and turning without forming a closed loop.

**Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
1. Walk forward for some distance.
2. Turn around (180 degrees) and walk forward again.
3. Turn towards 10 o'clock (which is approximately 120 degrees counterclockwise from the current direction) and continue walking.

**Trajectory Analysis:** We need to carefully consider each segment and ensure the transitions between them are smooth and continuous.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Segment 1:** Walk forward in a straight line.
2. **Segment 2:** Turn around (180 degrees) and walk forward again in the opposite direction.
3. **Segment 3:** Turn 120 degrees counterclockwise from the current direction (which was initially forward, now backwards) and continue walking.

For simplicity, let's assume each segment length is equal and the total time `T` is divided evenly into the three segments. Let's say each segment takes `T/3` time. 

Here's the code that generates the described trajectory:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    T = 1  # total time, adjust if needed
    if 0 <= t < T/3:
        # Segment 1: Walk forward from (0, 0) to (A, 0)
        x = t * (A / (T/3))
        y = 0
    elif T/3 <= t < 2*T/3:
        # Segment 2: Turn around and walk forward from (A, 0) to (0, 0)
        x = A - (t - T/3) * (A / (T/3))
        y = 0
    elif 2*T/3 <= t <= T:
        # Segment 3: Turn 120 degrees counterclockwise and continue walking
        # from (0, 0) in the new direction
        x = -(t - 2*T/3) * (A / (T/3)) * np.cos(np.radians(30))
        y = (t - 2*T/3) * (A / (T/3)) * np.sin(np.radians(30))
    else:
        x, y = 0, 0  # In case t is out of range

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
t_range = (0, 1)

# Example length for computation
A = 10  # Adjust length as needed
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Segment 1:** Moves in a straight line along the x-axis.
2. **Segment 2:** Moves back in the opposite direction along the same line.
3. **Segment 3:** Moves in a new direction 120 degrees counterclockwise from the initial line.

The code uses simple linear equations to represent each segment of the trajectory and ensures a smooth transition between segments. The `T` variable represents the total duration, divided into thirds for each segment. The `A` variable represents the distance traveled in each segment, and you can adjust it based on the required application.

        x = t * (A / (T/3))

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Walk forward, then turn around and walk forward again, then turn (towards 10 o'clock) and continue walking .'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: Certainly! Let's analyze the given trajectory description: "Walk forward, then turn around and walk forward again, then turn (towards 10 o'clock) and continue walking."

### Trajectory Analysis:

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:**
    - The trajectory is **open** because the person does not return to the starting point and continues walking in the end.

### Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:
Since the description is moderately simple but involves multiple actions, we can break it down accurately:

1. Walk forward for a certain distance.
2. Turn around (180 degrees) and walk the same distance back.
3. Turn towards the 10 o'clock direction (which is approximately 60 degrees to the left) and continue walking.

### Implementing Smooth Trajectory Segments:

1. Walk forward: \( t \in [0, 1] \)
2. Turn around and walk back: \( t \in [1, 2] \)
3. Turn towards 10 o'clock and continue: \( t \in [2, 3] \)

### Mathematical Functions:
We ensure smooth transitions with each part starting from where the last ended.

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    if 0 <= t < 1:
        # Walk forward with a uniform speed
        x = t
        y = 0
    elif 1 <= t < 2:
        # Turn around 180 degrees and walk back
        x = 1 - (t - 1)
        y = 0
    elif 2 <= t <= 3:
        # Turn 60 degrees to the left (10 o'clock direction) and continue walking
        x = 1 + np.cos(np.radians(60)) * (t - 2)
        y = -np.sin(np.radians(60)) * (t - 2)
    else:
        raise ValueError("t is out of range")
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
t_range = (0, 3)
```

This code will produce the following trajectory:

1. From \( t = 0 \) to \( t = 1 \): The person walks forward, so \( x(t) = t \) and \( y(t) = 0 \).
2. From \( t = 1 \) to \( t = 2 \): The person turns around and walks back, so \( x(t) = 1 - (t - 1) \) and \( y(t) = 0 \).
3. From \( t = 2 \) to \( t = 3 \): The person turns 60 degrees to the left and continues walking, so \( x(t) = 1 + \cos(60^\circ) \times (t - 2) \) and \( y(t) = -\sin(60^\circ) \times (t - 2) \).

Note: The cosine and sine functions are used to calculate the x and y components of the trajectory segment post-turn.

Model: Let's analyze the provided trajectory description step by step:

**Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:**
This trajectory is open since it describes a person walking forward, turning around, and then walking forward again, then turning towards 10 o'clock and continuing walking.

**Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
Let's break down the trajectory:
1. Walk forward for a certain distance.
2. Turn around 180 degrees and walk forward again.
3. Turn towards 10 o'clock (60 degrees to the left) and continue walking.

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- First, we walk forward. 
- Second, we turn around 180 degrees and walk back to initial position.
- Third, we turn 60 degrees to the left (towards 10 o'clock) and continue walking.

Ensuring smooth transitions and uniform speed, let's define the piecewise function accordingly.

**Mathematical Functions:**

        # First segment: Walk forward 1 unit
        x = t

User: 
**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.
再次强调：为了确保平滑过渡，您需要调整每一段段的公式，使其从上一段的终点坐标开始，而不是独立地重新定义 x 和 y。如果有不同的t段落，每一段的开始坐标和结束坐标应该在注释中标注出来！start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Walk forward, then turn around and walk forward again, then turn (towards 10 o'clock) and continue walking .'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:**
Based on the given description, the trajectory is open. The person is walking in an open path without forming a closed loop.

**Trajectory Analysis:**
1. Walk forward.
2. Turn around (which implies a 180-degree turn) and walk forward again.
3. Turn towards 10 o'clock and continue walking.

**Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
1. Walk forward for a certain distance.
2. Turn 180 degrees and walk forward the same distance back.
3. Turn towards 10 o'clock (slight left turn) from the end point of the last forward walk and continue in that direction.

### Code to Represent Trajectory

To present this in a mathematical form, we define the segments corresponding to the steps. The trajectory is linear with turns defined at specific points.

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    if t < 0.3:
        # Walk forward segment (0 to 1 on x-axis)
        x = t / 0.3
        y = 0
        # Segment starts at (0, 0) and ends at (1, 0)
    elif t < 0.6:
        # Turn around and walk forward again (reverse)
        x = 1 - ((t - 0.3) / 0.3)
        y = 0
        # Segment starts at (1, 0) and ends at (0, 0)
    else:
        # Turn slightly towards 10 o'clock and continue walking
        turn_angle = -30  # 10 o'clock is approximately 30 degrees to the left.
        x = (t - 0.6) * 1 / 0.4 * cos(turn_angle * pi / 180)
        y = (t - 0.6) * 1 / 0.4 * sin(turn_angle * pi / 180)
        # Segment starts at (0, 0) and goes in the direction of 10 o'clock

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
t_range = (0, 1)
```

This code defines a continuous trajectory where:
- From `t=0` to `t=0.3`, the person walks forward along the x-axis.
- From `t=0.3` to `t=0.6`, the person turns around and walks back along the x-axis.
- From `t=0.6` to `t=1`, the person turns towards 10 o'clock (a slight left angle) and continues in that direction.

Each segment smoothly follows the previous segment without abrupt starts or stops, and the speed is uniform across the entire range of `t`.
extracted_code: def shape_curve(t):
    if t < 0.3:
        # Walk forward segment (0 to 1 on x-axis)

        # Segment starts at (0, 0) and ends at (1, 0)

        # Turn around and walk forward again (reverse)
        x = 1 - ((t - 0.3) / 0.3)
        y = 0
        # Segment starts at (1, 0) and ends at (0, 0)

Model: ### Trajectory Decision:
**Open Trajectory** - The description suggests a path that keeps extending after every turn and walk, without forming a closed loop.

### Extract the Trajectory:
1. Walk forward -> Let's assume a fixed distance, say 10 units.
2. Turn around (180 degrees) -> Walk forward again for 10 units.
3. Turn towards 10 o'clock -> The turn towards the 10 o'clock direction is approximately a 30-degree turn to the left from the direction faced (if we assume walking direction is straight ahead).

### Trajectory Analysis:
We'll break the trajectory into three segments:
1. Walk forward in a straight line.
2. Turn around and walk back.
3. Turn to the 10 o'clock direction (slightly left) and walk forward.

We'll position these segments such that they start where the previous segment ends, ensuring smooth transitions.

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    if t < 1/3:
        # Segment 1: Walk forward
        x = 0
        y = 30 * t
    elif t < 2/3:
        # Segment 2: Turn around and walk back
        t_new = t - 1/3  # normalize t for this segment
        x = 0
        y = 10 - 30 * t_new
    else:
        # Segment 3: Turn to 10 o'clock and walk forward
        t_new = t - 2/3  # normalize t for this segment
        angle_radians = np.radians(150)  # 180 degrees - 30 degrees (10 o'clock direction)
        x = 10 * t_new * np.cos(angle_radians)
        y = (-10) + (10 * t_new * np.sin(angle_radians))
    
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
t_range = (0, 1)
```

Explanation:
- **Segment 1:** (0 <= t < 1/3): Walk forward, along the y-axis.
  - start: (0, 0), end: (0, 10)
- **Segment 2:** (1/3 <= t < 2/3): Turn around and walk forward again (essentially backtracking).
  - start: (0, 10), end: (0, 0)
- **Segment 3:** (2/3 <= t < 1): Turn towards 10 o'clock and continue walking.
  - start: (0, 0), end: adjusted with the cosine and sine for the direction.

Ensure continuity by smoothly transitioning between segments.

Feel free to adjust the step distances or angles if more specific details are available.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'Walk forward, then turn left and walk forward again, then turn right and continue walking .'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: Let's analyze the described trajectory and break it down into precise steps:

1. **Open or Closed Trajectory:** Based on the description, the trajectory is open because it is a sequence of movements in different directions without explicitly forming a loop.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
   - Walk forward.
   - Turn 90 degrees left and walk forward again.
   - Turn 90 degrees right and continue walking.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:**
   - The movement starts from an initial point, goes straight, then makes a left turn, followed by another straight path, then a right turn and a final straight path.
   - To ensure smooth transitions between segments, the coordinates at the end of one segment will serve as the start for the next.

Let's define the path mathematically:

1. Walk forward (let's assume 5 meters) from `(0, 0)` to `(5, 0)`.
2. Turn 90 degrees left and walk forward 5 meters. The new path is from `(5, 0)` to `(5, 5)`.
3. Turn 90 degrees right and continue walking (let's assume another 5 meters). The final path segment is from `(5, 5)` to `(10, 5)`.

We will use parameter `t` such that:
- `0 <= t < 1` covers the first segment.
- `1 <= t < 2` covers the second segment.
- `2 <= t <= 3` covers the third segment.

**Code Implementation:**

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    if 0 <= t < 1:
        # First segment: Walk forward from (0, 0) to (5, 0)
        # start_x = 0, start_y = 0, end_x = 5, end_y = 0
        x = 5 * t
        y = 0
    elif 1 <= t < 2:
        # Second segment: Turn left and walk forward from (5, 0) to (5, 5)
        # start_x = 5, start_y = 0, end_x = 5, end_y = 5
        x = 5
        y = 5 * (t - 1)
    elif 2 <= t <= 3:
        # Third segment: Turn right and walk forward from (5, 5) to (10, 5)
        # start_x = 5, start_y = 5, end_x = 10, end_y = 5
        x = 5 + 5 * (t - 2)
        y = 5
    else:
        raise ValueError("t is outside the defined range")

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
t_range = (0, 3)
```

In this implementation:
- The function `shape_curve(t)` transitions smoothly from one segment to another without abrupt changes.
- Coordinates change uniformly over time for each segment.
- Each segment’s start coordinates are derived from the end coordinates of the previous segment, ensuring continuity.

User: **Task:** draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:
1. You need to decide if it's a closed trajectory, and if it's not a closed curve (for example, the capital letter 'S', 'L', 'N', 'M', ...), then don't design the function as a closed curve. Otherwise, it needs to be designed as a closed trajectory, for example, a closed geometric figure, "walk around,"... In conclusion, you should decide by yourself.
2. Extract the curve/line/shape(trajectory) from the action description. The input is an action description, and you need to extract the human movement trajectory from it. If there are phrases like "turn around," indicating that the curve has overlapping parts, you need to consider this as well (this is not a normal two-dimensional curve but a three-dimensional curve related to time). In some cases, the parameter `t` in the `shape_curve(t)` function represents time.
3. Analysis of the curve/line/shape(trajectory). You need to analyze the trajectory first, instead of directly designing the code. (Thinking is important)
4. Mathematical functions: ONLY BE PRESENTED IN THE FORM BELOW IN THE CODE BLOCK (`python`).

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CODE IS CORRECT AND CAN RUN WITHOUT ERROR AND IS READY TO USE.
YOUR CODE SHOULD BE PRESENTED EXACTLY IN THE FORM BELOW:

```python
def shape_curve(t): # The curve starts at (0,0)
    ...
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)

```

################################

Now the input is:

I want to draw a Description = "Walk forward, then turn left and walk forward again, then turn right and continue walking ."
give me def shape_curve(t)
Model: To analyze this trajectory:

1. The person starts by walking forward.
2. Then they turn left and walk forward again.
3. Finally, they turn right and continue walking forward.

This is not a closed trajectory because the person is continually moving forward in different directions and does not return to the starting point. We will assume each segment of the path is linear and has equal length for simplicity.

Let's break down the trajectory into segments:
- The first segment is walking straight ahead.
- The second segment is turning left and walking straight ahead.
- The third segment is turning right and walking straight ahead.

We can represent this in a piecewise linear function.

Here’s the corresponding code:

```python
def shape_curve(t): # The curve starts at (0,0)
    if 0 <= t < 1:
        x = 0
        y = t
    elif 1 <= t < 2:
        x = - (t - 1)
        y = 1
    elif 2 <= t <= 3:
        x = -1 + (t - 2)
        y = 1 + (t - 2)
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
t_range = (0, 3)
```

Explanation:
- From t = 0 to t = 1, the person walks forward along the y-axis from (0, 0) to (0, 1).
- From t = 1 to t = 2, the person turns left and walks along the x-axis from (0, 1) to (-1, 1).
- From t = 2 to t = 3, the person turns right and continues walking forward along a diagonal path, ending at (-1 + 1, 1 + 1) or (0, 2).
extracted_code: def shape_curve(t): # The curve starts at (0,0)
    if 0 <= t < 1:
        x = 0
        y = t
    elif 1 <= t < 2:
        x = - (t - 1)
        y = 1
    elif 2 <= t <= 3:
        x = -1 + (t - 2)
        y = 1 + (t - 2)

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'A man mimics James Bond's classic action "Opening Gun Barrel Sequence"'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The described action, "Opening Gun Barrel Sequence," is reminiscent of James Bond’s iconic gun barrel walk, which is typically a smooth, spiraling path ending in the center. Thus, this trajectory can be considered closed.

**Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**

1. Walk straight (forward) for a few meters.
2. Start curving in a spiral motion until reaching the center, where the trajectory closes.

**Trajectory Analysis:** Given the iconic spiral and central focus, we can model it using a logarithmic or Archimedean spiral. One possible interpretation would be that James Bond spirals inward and then ends in the center, striking a final pose. We need to ensure the x and y coordinates change uniformly over `t`.

For simplicity and elegance, let's use an Archimedean spiral:
\[ r = a + b \theta \]

Where \( r \) is the radius, \( \theta \) is the angle, \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. To make it look more cinematic, we will use a decreasing spiral to simulate walking into the center.

**Mathematical Functions:**

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Constants to control the shape of the spiral
    a = 0.1
    b = 0.05
    theta = 2 * np.pi * t  # Using time `t` as angle for simplicity
    
    # Archimedean spiral equations
    r = a + b * theta
    x = r * np.cos(theta)
    y = r * np.sin(theta)

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (from 0 to 1 complete revolution and slightly more to add smoothness)
t_range = (0, 6)
```

With this code:
1. \( \theta \) increases uniformly with \( t \), creating a smooth, spiraling path.
2. \( x \) and \( y \) are computed to create the spiral trajectory of the James Bond gun barrel sequence.

Adjust `a` and `b` as needed for your desired spiral tightness and start point. This trajectory ensures smooth transitions and a continuous uniform path.

User: 
**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.
再次强调：为了确保平滑过渡，您需要调整每一段段的公式，使其从上一段的终点坐标开始，而不是独立地重新定义 x 和 y。如果有不同的t段落，每一段的开始坐标和结束坐标应该在注释中标注出来！start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y

4. **Mathematical Functions:** Present the final code strictly in the form provided below, ensuring it is correct and can run without errors and READY TO USE.

**Code Format:**
```python
def shape_curve(t):xz
    ...

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (start_value, end_value)
```

---

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'A man mimics Michael Jackson's "Moonwalk"'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: ### Open or Closed Trajectory Decision
The trajectory for mimicking Michael Jackson's "Moonwalk" is primarily linear and involves backward walking while appearing to move forward. Hence, the trajectory can be considered as **Open**.

### Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown (optional in this case)
Since the moonwalk is essentially walking backward in a straight line while the feet are sliding, we have a straightforward trajectory:

- Walk backward for a certain distance.

In this specific task, we don't need to break it down into multiple complex steps because it is a simple linear movement.

### Trajectory Analysis
For the shape of the trajectory, we'll assume a straight line from (0, 0) to (-10, 0) over the interval of `t`.

### Mathematical Functions

Here's the code that creates this simple linear trajectory:

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    # We assume t ranges from 0 to 1
    x = -10 * t  # Linear movement backward
    y = 0       # No movement along the y axis
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 1)
```

### Explanation:
1. The function `shape_curve(t)` defines a simple backward linear movement.
2. The `x` component changes uniformly from 0 to -10 as t goes from 0 to 1.
3. The `y` component remains zero because there is no vertical movement in a moonwalk.
4. The `t_range` is set from 0 to 1 for a uniform and easy-to-understand movement range.

This delivers a smooth, continuous, and straightforward trajectory for mimicking the moonwalk.
extracted_code: def shape_curve(t):
    # We assume t ranges from 0 to 1
    x = -10 * t  # Linear movement backward
    y = 0       # No movement along the y axis
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 1)

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'A man mimics Indiana Jones' "Temple Run"'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: Based on the description of a man mimicking Indiana Jones' "Temple Run," here's the breakdown and formulation for the trajectory:

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory is likely open, as "Temple Run" involves running through a path rather than around a closed loop.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:** To keep it simple, I’ll assume some typical movements from "Temple Run":
   - Start at a given point.
   - Run straight for some distance.
   - Turn 90 degrees to the right.
   - Run straight again.
   - Turn 90 degrees to the left.
   - Continue straight.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** We'll ensure smooth transitions:
   - `t1` for the first straight segment.
   - `t2` for the second straight segment after turning.
   - `t3` for the third straight segment after another turn. 

### Mathematical Representation:

1. The person starts at (0, 0) and runs straight (along the y-axis).
2. The person then turns 90 degrees right (along the x-axis).
3. The person then turns 90 degrees left and continues straight (back along y-axis).

This results in an L-shaped trajectory. Here is the final code:

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    if 0 <= t < 1:
        # t from 0 to 1 represents first segment
        x = 0
        y = 10 * t  # Move straight up along y-axis
    elif 1 <= t < 2:
        # t from 1 to 2 represents second segment (turn 90 degrees right)
        x = 10 * (t - 1)
        y = 10  # Continue horizontally along x, y remains the same
    elif 2 <= t <= 3:
        # t from 2 to 3 represents third segment (turn 90 degrees left)
        x = 10
        y = 10 - 10 * (t - 2)  # Continue down along y
    else:
        x, y = None, None  # Out of range

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 3)
```

### Explanation:
- The range of `t` is from 0 to 3.
- In the first segment (`0 <= t < 1`), the person moves along the y-axis from (0, 0) to (0, 10).
- In the second segment (`1 <= t < 2`), the person moves along the x-axis from (0, 10) to (10, 10).
- In the third segment (`2 <= t <= 3`), the person moves back along the y-axis from (10, 10) to (10, 0).

This trajectory follows an L-shape with smooth and continuous transitions between each segment.

    if 0 <= t < 1:
        # t from 0 to 1 represents first segment

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.
再次强调：为了确保平滑过渡，您需要调整每一段段的公式，使其从上一段的终点坐标开始，而不是独立地重新定义 x 和 y。如果有不同的t段落，每一段的开始坐标和结束坐标应该在注释中标注出来！start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'A man mimics Charlie Chaplin’s "The Tramp’s Walk"'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: Given the task to represent a trajectory of a man mimicking Charlie Chaplin's "The Tramp's Walk," we need to analyze the motion and break it down into a possible mathematical representation. This iconic walk involves distinct components like a pronounced toe-out feet position, swaying side-to-side, and a slight zigzag motion.

### Closed or Open Trajectory Decision
- Based on the description, the trajectory here will represent open movements as there's no mention of returning to a starting point or enclosing a space.

### Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown
1. **Movement Sequence**:
   - **Step 1**: Walk forward with a sway to the right.
   - **Step 2**: Walk forward with a sway to the left.
   - **Step 3**: Repeat the above steps with an alternate toe-out foot position.

### Trajectory Analysis
Analyzed as continuous, combining swaying and forward motion. Swaying creates a sinusoidal path around a forward trajectory.

For simplicity, we assume:
- The man moves forward while swaying left and right in a continuous sinusoidal fashion.
- Since the movement is periodic and continuous, the sway will be modeled using a sinusoidal function, while the forward movement is linear.

### Mathematical Functions

The sinusoidal sway can be represented by the following function:
- \( x(t) = A \sin(Bt) \)
  Where \( A \) is the amplitude of the sway (how far left and right), \( B \) is the frequency (how fast he sways).

The forward linear movement can be represented by:
- \( y(t) = C \cdot t \)
  Where \( C \) is a constant representing the speed.

We ensure the transitions are smooth by keeping the path continuous, thus x and y will have a continuous progression.

### Code

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Parameters for the sway and forward motion
    A = 1  # amplitude of sway (meters)
    B = 2 * np.pi  # frequency of sway (1 oscillation per second if t in seconds)
    C = 1  # forward speed (meters per second)

    x = A * np.sin(B * t)
    y = C * t
    
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 10)  # Assuming t ranges from 0 to 10 seconds
```

In this code:
- \( x(t) = 1 \sin(2\pi t) \)
- \( y(t) = 1 \cdot t \)

This setup implies:
- A person sways 1 meter left/right within 1 second intervals.
- The person moves forward at a constant speed.

The code is ready to use and represents Charlie Chaplin’s "The Tramp’s Walk" in a simplified mathematical form as a trajectory.

def shape_curve(t):
    # Parameters for the sway and forward motion

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'A man mimics Fred Astaire’s "Top Hat Dance"'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: ### Analysis:

From the description, Fred Astaire's "Top Hat Dance" involves elegant and smooth footwork that includes spins, straight walks, and possibly some complex steps. This can include circular trajectories, straight lines, or even sharp turns.

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** This trajectory is likely **open**, as dance routines usually start and end at different positions.

2. **Trajectory Breakdown:** Since the "Top Hat Dance" is complex, here is a simplified breakdown of potential steps in the dance routine:
    - Start with a smooth curve representing side steps in one direction.
    - Continue with a sharp turn indicative of a spin.
    - Follow with a straight line, symbolizing a stride.
    - End with another smooth curve or arc, representing a final flourish.

We'll model this trajectory using smooth mathematical functions to maintain continuity and elegance.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:**
    - The trajectory will be designed to ensure no sudden jumps.
    - Smooth transitions between sections will be implemented.

### Trajectory Code

The following `shape_curve(t)` function will represent this dance with specified segments:
- Segment 1: A quarter circle representing the initial smooth curve.
- Segment 2: A straight line indicating a stride.
- Segment 3: Another curve for a final flourish.

**Code:**
```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    if 0 <= t < 1:
        # Segment 1: Quarter circle, radius 1
        angle = np.pi/2 * t  # from 0 to pi/2
        x = np.cos(angle)
        y = np.sin(angle)
        
    elif 1 <= t < 2:
        # Segment 2: Straight line from (0, 1) to (2, 1)
        x = t - 1
        y = 1
        
    elif 2 <= t <= 3:
        # Segment 3: Quarter circle, radius 1, from (2, 1) to (2, 0)
        angle = np.pi/2 * (t - 2)
        x = 2 + np.sin(angle)
        y = 1 - np.cos(angle)
    
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
t_range = (0, 3)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Segment 1:** From `t = 0` to `t = 1`, the trajectory follows a quarter circle with radius 1, starting from `(1, 0)` to `(0, 1)`.
   - **Start coordinates:** (1, 0)
   - **End coordinates:** (0, 1)

2. **Segment 2:** From `t = 1` to `t = 2`, the man strides forward in a straight line from `(0, 1)` to `(1, 1)`.
   - **Start coordinates:** (0, 1)
   - **End coordinates:** (2, 1)

3. **Segment 3:** From `t = 2` to `t = 3`, there is another quarter circle, moving from `(2, 1)` to `(2, 0)`.
   - **Start coordinates:** (2, 1)
   - **End coordinates:** (2, 0)

This ensures the path is smooth, with each segment starting exactly from the previous segment's endpoint.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = ''. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: Since the input Description is empty, I will assume that we need to create a default trajectory. For simplicity, let's create an open trajectory that describes a basic path in the shape of the letter 'L'.

### Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:
- **Decision:** Open trajectory (since the shape of the letter 'L' is open).

### Trajectory Analysis:
- The 'L' shape path can be broken down into two segments:
  1. Walk forward for a certain distance.
  2. Turn 90 degrees left and walk forward for another certain distance.

### Mathematical Functions:
We'll define the mathematical functions for the trajectory segments and ensure smooth transitions between segments. Here, the parameter `t` will range from 0 to 2, where the first segment covers 0 to 1 and the second segment covers 1 to 2.

```python
def shape_curve(t):

**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.
再次强调：为了确保平滑过渡，您需要调整每一段段的公式，使其从上一段的终点坐标开始，而不是独立地重新定义 x 和 y。如果有不同的t段落，每一段的开始坐标和结束坐标应该在注释中标注出来！start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'A man mimics Fred Astaire’s "Top Hat Dance"'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To draw the trajectory of a man's movement mimicking Fred Astaire's "Top Hat Dance", we need to consider the typical movements involved in a dance routine like this. The movements could include circular twirls, forward and backward steps, and side steps.

Let's assume a simplified version of mimicking such a dance consists of a combination of arcs and straight steps forming a complex but graceful path. This would involve multiple smooth transitions with a consistent speed.

**Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory is **closed** because a dance typically loops or ends back similar to where it started.

As the specific steps and their order are not explicitly detailed, I'll provide a plausible breakdown:

### Trajectory Breakdown:
1. Start at the origin (0, 0).
2. Move forward (positive x direction) for 2 meters.
3. Perform a quarter circle turning left (90 degrees turn).
4. Move forward again.
5. Another quarter circle turning left.
6. Move forward and twirl around in a circular fashion.

Let's define the trajectory in the following mathematical forms:

### Mathematical Functions:
We'll use parametric equations for linear and circular segments. Assume the dance can be broken down as:
1. Initial forward move.
2. Quarter circle left turn.
3. Forward move.
4. Another quarter circle left turn.
5. Continuation into twirl pattern.

The trajectory will be defined over a time parameter `t`.

### Code Implementation:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def shape_curve(t):
    if t < 1:
        # Start at (0, 0), move 2 units forward: x = 2t, y = 0
        x = 2 * t
        y = 0
        # Segment range: start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y: (0, 0, 2, 0)

    elif 1 <= t < 2:
        # Quarter circle left turn from (2, 0) with radius 1, counterclockwise
        theta = np.pi / 2 * (t - 1)
        x = 2 + np.cos(np.pi / 2 * (1 - t))
        y = np.sin(np.pi / 2 * (t - 1))
        # Segment range: (2, 0, 3, 1)

    elif 2 <= t < 3:
        # Move forward from (2, 1) for 2 units: x = 3 - (2 - t), y = 1
        x = 3 - (t - 2)
        y = 1
        # Segment range: (3, 1, 1, 1)

    elif 3 <= t < 4:
        # Another quarter circle left turn from (1, 1)
        theta = np.pi / 2 * (t - 3)
        x = 1 - np.sin(np.pi / 2 * (t - 3))
        y = 1 - np.cos(np.pi / 2 * (t - 3))
        # Segment range: (1, 1, 1, 0)

    else:
        # Twirl around in a circular fashion
        t_shift = t - 4  # Shift time for this segment
        radius = 0.5
        x = 1 + radius * np.cos(2 * np.pi * t_shift)
        y = -radius * np.sin(2 * np.pi * t_shift)
        # Segment range: (1, 0) and back around

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 6)  # Arbitrary end value for completion

# Plotting the trajectory for visualization
t_values = np.linspace(t_range[0], t_range[1], 400)
trajectory = [shape_curve(t) for t in t_values]
x_values, y_values = zip(*trajectory)

plt.plot(x_values, y_values)
plt.xlabel("x")
plt.ylabel("y")
plt.title("Fred Astaire's Top Hat Dance Trajectory")
plt.grid(True)
plt.axis("equal")
plt.show()
```

### Explanation:
- **Step 1:** Moves forward initially.
- **Steps 2 and 4:** Perform quarter-circle left turns.
- **Step 3:** Forward movement after the first turn.
- **Step 5:** Twirls in a circular pattern upon completing the last quarter turn.

This code should be able to run smoothly and plot the trajectory for a simplified dance mimicking. The transitions between segments are made smooth, as each subsequent segment begins from where the last one ended.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = ''. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: Given the input "I want to draw a Description = ''. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`.", it looks like there's no actual description provided. Therefore, I'll create a simple example to show how the function can be structured for a common trajectory. Let's assume we want to draw a circular path as our trajectory.

Here's the detailed breakdown based on the instructions provided:

### Closed or Open Trajectory Decision
**Decision:** Closed trajectory (as a circle is a geometric figure and involves "walking around").

### Trajectory Analysis
Since the task is to create a continuous trajectory with no abrupt jumps and a constant speed, a circle fits well into these criteria.

### Mathematical Functions
The parametric function of a circle with radius `r` centered at the origin `(0, 0)` and uniformly varying parameter `t` is:

\[ x = r \cos(t) \]
\[ y = r \sin(t) \]

To ensure continuity and a smooth path, `t` should range from `0` to `2π` to complete one full circle.

### Code Implementation

Here's the final code implementing the circular trajectory:

```python
import math

def shape_curve(t):
    r = 1  # Radius of the circle
    x = r * math.cos(t)
    y = r * math.sin(t)
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
# Completing one full circle
t_range = (0, 2 * math.pi)
```

This code provides a simple yet continuous and closed trajectory of a circle. Adjust the radius `r` if a different sized circle is desired. The `t_range` from `0` to `2π` ensures the path is complete.
extracted_code: import math

def shape_curve(t):
    r = 1  # Radius of the circle
    x = r * math.cos(t)
    y = r * math.sin(t)
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
# Completing one full circle
t_range = (0, 2 * math.pi)

**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.
再次强调：为了确保平滑过渡，您需要调整每一段段的公式，使其从上一段的终点坐标开始，而不是独立地重新定义 x 和 y。如果有不同的t段落，每一段的开始坐标和结束坐标应该在注释中标注出来！start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y

4. **Mathematical Functions:** Present the final code strictly in the form provided below, ensuring it is correct and can run without errors and READY TO USE.

**Code Format:**
```python
def shape_curve(t):xz
    ...

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (start_value, end_value)
```

---

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'A man mimics Fred Astaire’s "Top Hat Dance"'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: 1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory mimicking Fred Astaire's "Top Hat Dance" would be considered **closed**, as dance movements can be complex and often return to a starting position or involve repeating patterns.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
   - Assume the dance includes the following movements:
     1. Step forward while raising the hat.
     2. Step backward and swing the hat.
     3. Step to the right while doing a twirl.
     4. Step to the left and do a pose.
     5. Return to the original starting position.

   The breakdown might look like this:
   - Step forward for 2 meters while raising the hat (start_x = 0, start_y = 0; end_x = 0, end_y = 2).
   - Step backward for 2 meters and swing the hat (start_x = 0, start_y = 2; end_x = 0, end_y = 0).
   - Step to the right for 2 meters while twirling (start_x = 0, start_y = 0; end_x = 2, end_y = 0).
   - Step to the left for 2 meters and pose (start_x = 2, start_y = 0; end_x = 0, end_y = 0).
   - Return to starting position (just a completion).
  
3. **Trajectory Analysis:** 
   - The trajectory involves moving in a specific path: forward, backward, right, left, and finally returning to the original position.
   - Each segment should smoothly transition to the next, ensuring there are no jumps or abrupt shifts.
   - Each segment will be represented with respect to time 't', ensuring uniform speed.

4. **Mathematical Functions:**

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    # Total time divided into parts for smooth transition
    if t < 1:  # t in range [0, 1): step forward
        # start_x = 0, start_y = 0; end_x = 0, end_y = 2
        x = 0
        y = 2 * t
    elif t < 2:  # t in range [1, 2): step backward
        # start_x = 0, start_y = 2; end_x = 0, end_y = 0
        x = 0
        y = 2 * (2 - t)
    elif t < 3:  # t in range [2, 3): step to the right
        # start_x = 0, start_y = 0; end_x = 2, end_y = 0
        x = 2 * (t - 2)
        y = 0
    elif t < 4:  # t in range [3, 4): step to the left and pose
        # start_x = 2, start_y = 0; end_x = 0, end_y = 0
        x = 2 * (4 - t)
        y = 0
    else:  # complete the dance by returning to starting position
        # start_x = 0, start_y = 0; end_x = 0, end_y = 0
        x = 0
        y = 0

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 4)
``` 

This code will create a trajectory that mimics a simple representation of the movements in Fred Astaire's "Top Hat Dance," transitioning smoothly between each segment.

Model: **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Since the description does not provide enough details about a specific shape or movement pattern, I'll treat the trajectory as open by default.

**Trajectory Analysis:** Without a specified trajectory or motion described, I cannot derive a complex movement or trajectory breakdown. Therefore, I will provide a simple continuous trajectory—let's say a straight line (e.g., walking forward). 

**Code Format:**
```python
def shape_curve(t):
    # Starting point (0, 0)
    start_x, start_y = 0, 0
    # Assume a constant speed along the x-axis for simplicity

    y = start_y  # y remains constant
    
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 10)
```

This code describes a simple trajectory where a person moves straight forward along the x-axis from point (0, 0) to (10, 0) as `t` varies from 0 to 10.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'A man mimics Fred Astaire’s "Top Hat Dance"'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: **1. Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:**  
The trajectory of "A man mimics Fred Astaire’s 'Top Hat Dance'" is likely to be **closed**, as the dance likely involves looping motions and returning to the starting position, similar to choreography that completes a sequence.

**2. Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**  
For the dance, we can simplify it into several distinct movements. Here's a break down of the general flow of movements:

1. Start at (0, 0).
2. Step forward for 2 meters.
3. Turn 45 degrees to the right and step diagonally for 1 meter.
4. Turn 135 degrees to the left (which aligns almost backwards) and step back for 2 meters.
5. Step sideways to the right for 1 meter.
6. Turn 90 degrees to the left and step forward for 2 meters.
7. Finish with a spin (return to starting position).

**3. Trajectory Analysis:**  
We will ensure smooth transitions and continuous movement from one action to the next. The final coordinates will be set based on these segments. 

### Start and End Points for Segments:
1. Start: (0, 0) → End: (0, 0)
2. Start: (0, 0) → End: (0, 2)
3. Start: (0, 2) → End: (0.707, 2.707)  # 45 degrees
4. Start: (0.707, 2.707) → End: (0.707, 0.707)  # Backward step
5. Start: (0.707, 0.707) → End: (1.707, 0.707)  # Right step
6. Start: (1.707, 0.707) → End: (1.707, 2.707)  # Forward step
7. Spin back to the start.

Let's consolidate this into a coherent function that executes the movements based on time `t`.

**4. Mathematical Functions:**  
Here is the code that represents the provided trajectory:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    x, y = 0, 0  # Start coordinates
    
    if t < 1:
        # Movement 1: Forward
        x, y = 0, 2 * t  # 0 to 2 meters forward, t goes from 0 to 1
    elif t < 2:
        # Movement 2: Diagonal Step
        angle = np.pi / 4  # 45 degrees

**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.
再次强调：为了确保平滑过渡，您需要调整每一段段的公式，使其从上一段的终点坐标开始，而不是独立地重新定义 x 和 y。如果有不同的t段落，每一段的开始坐标和结束坐标应该在注释中标注出来！start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'A man mimics Fred Astaire’s "Top Hat Dance"'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: 1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory of a person mimicking Fred Astaire’s "Top Hat Dance" can be considered as a closed trajectory, as it involves a series of movements that might loop back on themselves during the dance performance.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
   - Start at the origin (0, 0).
   - Step forward for 2 meters (12 o'clock).
   - Turn 45 degrees right and step diagonally (1-2 o'clock) for 1 meter.
   - Turn 45 degrees right and step forward for 2 meters (3 o'clock).
   - Turn 45 degrees left and step diagonally (2-3 o'clock) for 1 meter.
   - Turn 45 degrees left and step backward for 2 meters (6 o'clock).
   - Turn 45 degrees left and step diagonally (5-6 o'clock) for 1 meter.
   - Turn 45 degrees left and step forward for 2 meters (9 o'clock).
   - Turn 45 degrees right and step diagonally (8-9 o'clock) for 1 meter.
   - Return to the starting position.

2.1 **Trajectory Breakdown in Steps:**
   - Step 1: (0, 0) → Step forward for 2 meters to (0, 2)
   - Step 2: (0, 2) → Turn 45° right, move to (0.707, 2.707)
   - Step 3: (0.707, 2.707) → Turn 45° right, move to (2, 2)
   - Step 4: (2, 2) → Turn 45° left, move to (2.707, 1.293)
   - Step 5: (2.707, 1.293) → Turn 45° left, move to (2, -1.515)
   - Step 6: (2, -1.515) → Turn 45° left, move to (1.293, -2.707)
   - Step 7: (1.293, -2.707) → Turn 45° left, move to (0, -2)
   - Step 8: (0, -2) → Turn 45° right, move to (-0.707, -1.293)
   - Step 9: (-0.707, -1.293) → Return to origin, (0, 0)

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** The shape here includes forward and diagonal moves but also includes returning to the starting point, creating a closed figure. Each step has been calculated to ensure smooth transitions when drawn.

To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments.

# Specify the range of t (it is important)

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = ''. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:**  
The provided description is empty, thus no trajectory can be derived. There is no specific geometric shape or path detailed in the description to indicate if the trajectory should be closed or open.

**Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**  
Since there is no description given, no breakdown of movements can be extracted.

**Trajectory Analysis:**  
As there are no movements or directions specified, there's nothing to analyze for continuity, overlapping parts, or coordinate changes over time.

**Mathematical Functions:**  
Since there is no shape or movement described, no code can be generated.

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    pass  # No specific trajectory to define

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 0)  # No movement defined
```

In conclusion, please provide a specific description of the trajectory you wish to define.

**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'A man mimics Fred Astaire’s "Top Hat Dance"'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: 1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory is likely to be open as it mimics a dance and does not form a closed geometric figure. A dance involves various movements that can start and stop at different points.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**  
   - Step 1: Step forward (1 meter)
   - Step 2: Swing left leg out (0.5 meters) while turning 90 degrees right
   - Step 3: Step back (1 meter)
   - Step 4: Swing right leg out (0.5 meters) while turning 90 degrees left
   - Step 5: Return to the starting position (by stepping forward)
   - Step 6: Raise arms upward (while standing still for 1 second)
   - Step 7: Take a bow (lean forward then stand straight)

This sequence outlines the general flow of the dance movements. Now we can analyze the trajectory based on the described dance movements.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:**  
To ensure a smooth transition, the trajectory will be defined such that each movement connects seamlessly to the next. This includes forward movements, turns, and leg swings.

### Mathematical Functions:
```python
def shape_curve(t):
    if t < 1:
        # Step forward 1 meter - from (0,0) to (1,0)
        x = t

        x = 0 + (t - 4) * 1
        y = 0
    elif t < 6:
        # Raise arms upward (static position) - remains at (1,0)
        x = 1
        y = (t - 5) * 0.25  # gradually raises arms
    else:
        # Take a bow (lean forward then straight) - (1,0) to (1,-0.5) back to (1,0)
        total_time = t - 5
        if total_time < 1:
            # Lean forward
            x = 1
            y = -total_time * 0.5
        else:
            # Back to standing position
            x = 1
            y = 0

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 7)
```

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'A man mimics Fred Astaire’s "Top Hat Dance"'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: To approach this task, we need to translate Fred Astaire's "Top Hat Dance" into a continuous trajectory in mathematical form. The "Top Hat Dance" includes various movements such as walking forward, turning, bowing, and spins. Given the complexity, the trajectory will be open-ended, as the dance steps generally do not return to the starting point in a simple loop.

**Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** 
The trajectory is open because the dance involves movements in various directions and does not naturally form a closed geometric figure.

**Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**

1. Begin from the starting point: walk straight for a few meters.
2. Turn 90 degrees to the right and walk for a few steps.
3. Perform a small spin.
4. Walk straight again for a few meters.
5. Turn 90 degrees to the left and walk for a few steps.
6. Bow by bending straight down slightly, then return to walking.

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- We must represent these movements with line segments and curves.
- Ensure that the transitions between movements are smooth.

**Mathematical Functions:**

t_range = (0, 1.0)
```

In this function, the dance is simplified into linear and circular segments for a smooth transition. The range of `t` is from 0 to 1, ensuring continuous change in coordinates. Adjustments may be needed based on more precise dance movement interpretation.

**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.
再次强调：为了确保平滑过渡，您需要调整每一段段的公式，使其从上一段的终点坐标开始，而不是独立地重新定义 x 和 y。如果有不同的t段落，每一段的开始坐标和结束坐标应该在注释中标注出来！start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y

4. **Mathematical Functions:** Present the final code strictly in the form provided below, ensuring it is correct and can run without errors and READY TO USE.

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (start_value, end_value)
```

---

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = ''. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: Sure, I'll go through the steps to create a function in the specified format.

Given that the description is empty, here's a step-by-step outline and code for a simple example of an open trajectory, like a straight line.

### 1. Closed or Open Trajectory Decision
For an empty description, I'll assume the simplest form of trajectory—a straight line—to illustrate the general structure.

### 2. Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown
No complex breakdown is needed because the description is empty. For illustration, I'll assume a simple straight line.

### 3. Trajectory Analysis
For this example, let's create a straight diagonal line from point (0, 0) to point (10, 10). This will ensure a smooth trajectory with a consistent speed.
- The equation of a line moving diagonally with uniform speed can be written as:
    - `x = t`
    - `y = t`
- The range of `t` will be from `0` to `1` to ensure a smooth transition from the start to the end of the line.

### 4. Mathematical Functions
Here is the function that produces a straight diagonal line:

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    # Diagonal line from (0, 0) to (10, 10)
    x = 10 * t  # linearly interpolates x from 0 to 10 as t goes from 0 to 1
    y = 10 * t  # linearly interpolates y from 0 to 10 as t goes from 0 to 1

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 1)
```

Feel free to adjust the starting and ending points or the direction of the line based on specific needs.
extracted_code: def shape_curve(t):
    # Diagonal line from (0, 0) to (10, 10)
    x = 10 * t  # linearly interpolates x from 0 to 10 as t goes from 0 to 1
    y = 10 * t  # linearly interpolates y from 0 to 10 as t goes from 0 to 1

    return x, y

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'A man mimics Fred Astaire’s "Top Hat Dance"'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: ### Trajectory Analysis:

Fred Astaire’s "Top Hat Dance" involves a series of graceful, smooth movements including spins, side steps, forward and backward movements. This dance can be broken down into continuous segments that closely resemble geometric shapes, which are often connected smoothly.

### Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:

The "Top Hat Dance" involves repeatable dancing patterns, including movements that bring the dancer back to the starting point (spins and loops). Therefore, we consider this as a **Closed Trajectory**.

### Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown (Due to Complexity):
Here's a simplified interpretation:
1. Start with a loop (representing a spin).
2. Move forward and then make an arc to the right.
3. Again spin and then move diagonally forward left.
4. Finally, close the loop with another spin.

### Trajectory Segmentation for Smooth Transition:
- **Segment 1:** Loop/Spin (Circular path for simple loop)
- **Segment 2:** Forward movement with a right arc (semi-circular path)
- **Segment 3:** Spin again (Circular path)
- **Segment 4:** Diagonal movement left (simple linear path)
- **Segment 5:** Spin to connect back to the start

These segments are interconnected for smooth transitions.

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    if 0 <= t < 1:
        # Segment 1: Loop/Spin (circular path)
        theta = 2 * np.pi * t  # theta ranges from 0 to 2pi as t moves from 0 to 1
        x = np.cos(theta)
        y = np.sin(theta)
    elif 1 <= t < 2:
        # Segment 2: Forward movement with a right arc (semi-circular path)
        end_x1, end_y1 = 1, 0  # Start from end of Segment 1 (x cos(2pi), y sin(2pi)) which is (1,0)
        theta = -np.pi * (t - 1)  # semi-circular arc to the right
        x = end_x1 + np.cos(np.pi) + np.cos(theta)
        y = end_y1 + np.sin(np.pi) + np.sin(theta)
    elif 2 <= t < 3:
        # Segment 3: Spin again (circular path)
        start_x2, start_y2 = 1, 0  # Start from the end of Segment 2 anticipated landing
        theta = 2 * np.pi * (t - 2)
        x = start_x2 + np.cos(theta)
        y = start_y2 + np.sin(theta)
    elif 3 <= t < 4:
        # Segment 4: Diagonal movement left (linear path)
        start_x3, start_y3 = 1, 0  # End from Segment 3, anticipated landing
        end_x3, end_y3 = 0, 1  # Diagonally left
        x = np.linspace(start_x3, end_x3, 100)[int(100 * (t - 3))]
        y = np.linspace(start_y3, end_y3, 100)[int(100 * (t - 3))]
    elif 4 <= t < 5:
        # Segment 5: Another loop to connect
        start_x4, start_y4 = 0, 1
        theta = 2 * np.pi * (t - 4)
        x = start_x4 + np.cos(theta)
        y = start_y4 + np.sin(theta)

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t
# Each t increment represents one segment t_range determined for a 5-step motion
t_range = (0, 5)
```

In this code, the movements are interpreted in a simple form to mimic a dancer’s path, considering the sequence of movements Fred Astaire might show: spins, arcs, and diagonal strides. The path is simplified to illustrate the continuous, smooth trajectory without jumping or abrupt changes, and looped back, ensuring it’s a closed path.

**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.
再次强调：为了确保平滑过渡，您需要调整每一段段的公式，使其从上一段的终点坐标开始，而不是独立地重新定义 x 和 y。如果有不同的t段落，每一段的开始坐标和结束坐标应该在注释中标注出来！start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y

4. **Mathematical Functions:** Present the final code strictly in the form provided below, ensuring it is correct and can run without errors and READY TO USE.

**Code Format:**
```python
def shape_curve(t):xz
    ...

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (start_value, end_value)
```

---

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = ''. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: Given that the provided description is an empty string, it appears that no specific trajectory or shape has been described. Hence, there is no trajectory to extract or analyze.

**Output Decision:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Not applicable due to the lack of description.
2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:** Not applicable.
3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Not applicable due to the lack of description.

However, for completeness, here is a generic template for defining a simple trajectory (straight line) based on the format provided:

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    # Assuming a simple trajectory: straight line from (0, 0) to (10, 10)
    # Both x and y increase uniformly as t goes from 0 to 1
    
    start_x, start_y = 0, 0
    end_x, end_y = 10, 10
    
    x = start_x + (end_x - start_x) * t
    y = start_y + (end_y - start_y) * t

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 1)
```

This template represents a basic straight-line trajectory. If more details were provided, we could tailor the shape_curve function to match the specific description given.
extracted_code: def shape_curve(t):
    # Assuming a simple trajectory: straight line from (0, 0) to (10, 10)
    # Both x and y increase uniformly as t goes from 0 to 1
    
    start_x, start_y = 0, 0
    end_x, end_y = 10, 10
    
    x = start_x + (end_x - start_x) * t
    y = start_y + (end_y - start_y) * t

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'A man mimics Fred Astaire’s "Top Hat Dance"'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:**
For Fred Astaire's "Top Hat Dance," which likely involves a complex series of movements, including spins, turns, and precise footwork, the trajectory is better represented as `closed`. This is because it would involve a continuous, looping pattern rather than an open path.

**Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:**
Since Fred Astaire's "Top Hat Dance" is complex and involves smooth, continuous movements, we can break it down into simple steps.

1. Walk forward for 2 meters, then spin 360 degrees clockwise.
2. Walk backward for 2 meters, then step to the right for 1 meter.
3. Walk forward for 1.5 meters, then turn 90 degrees to the left.
4. Repeat the above movements fluently to form a complex, looping dance path.

**Trajectory Analysis:**
To ensure smooth transitions and a uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, we will break the movements down into segments that ensure continuous, looping patterns. Each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts.

**Mathematical Functions:**
Here is the Python code defining the trajectory:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Define parameters for the piecewise function
    segments = [
        (0, 1, lambda t: (2*t, 0)),                # Walk forward for 2 meters
        (1, 2, lambda t: (2*np.cos(2*np.pi*(t-1)), 2*np.sin(2*np.pi*(t-1)))),  # Spin 360 degrees
        (2, 3, lambda t: (2 - 2*(t-2), 0)),        # Walk backward for 2 meters
        (3, 4, lambda t: (0, (t-3))),              # Step right for 1 meter
        (4, 5, lambda t: ((t-4), 1)),              # Walk forward for 1.5 meters
        (5, 6, lambda t: (1.5*np.cos(np.pi/2*(t-5)), 1 + 1.5*np.sin(np.pi/2*(t-5)))),  # Turn 90 degrees left
        # Repeat movements to simulate looping dance path
        (6, 7, lambda t: (2*(t-6), 0)),            # Continue loop (forward)
    ]

    # Ensure continuity and smooth transition
    for start_t, end_t, func in segments:
        if start_t <= t < end_t:
            x, y = func(t)
            return x, y
    return 0, 0  # Default returned value if t is out of range, just for safety

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 7)
```

**Explanation and Continuity:**
- The trajectory follows a piecewise function that defines distinct segments of the dance.
- Each segment returns x and y coordinates ensuring smooth transitions.
- Adjusting `t` parameters `start_t, end_t` and segment functions ensures continuous movement.
- The loops in walking, spinning, and turning mimic the dance steps, closing the overall path.

The `t_range` is specified from 0 to 7 for a single full loop of movements representing a simplified version of Fred Astaire's "Top Hat Dance."

**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.
再次强调：为了确保平滑过渡，您需要调整每一段段的公式，使其从上一段的终点坐标开始，而不是独立地重新定义 x 和 y。如果有不同的t段落，每一段的开始坐标和结束坐标应该在注释中标注出来！start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y

Given the lack of complexity and precision in the description ('Description = ''), I will assume a straightforward straight line trajectory.

Here is the implementation:

```python
def shape_curve(t):
    # A simple linear trajectory from (0,0) to (1,1)
    x = t
    y = t

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 1)
```

In this case:
1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The simple line trajectory from (0,0) to (1,1) is open.
2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:** Not applicable as the description is empty and the trajectory is straightforward.
3. **Trajectory Analysis:** A single straight line from (0,0) to (1,1) is straightforward with no overlapping parts.

Feel free to further detail the trajectory or provide additional complexity if you have a more specific description or requirement!

    # A simple linear trajectory from (0,0) to (1,1)
    x = t
    y = t

    return x, y

t_range = (0, 1)

User: 
**Task:** Draw a continuous trajectory to represent a specified curve/line/shape(trajectory) of a person, according to the given [Description].

**YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CONTAIN:**

1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** Decide if the trajectory is closed or open based on the description. For example, if it's a geometric figure or involves "walking around," it's likely closed. If it's a path like the letter 'S', 'L', etc., it's open.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown: (ONLY DO WHEN Trajectoy is complex or vague. If it's simple, you can skip this step)** Break down the action description into simple, precise steps. Use a fixed format to describe the movement (e.g., "Walk forward for 5 meters, then turn 90 degrees right"). This helps in extracting the trajectory.

2.1 Avoid overcomplicating the movement.Keep it accurate and straightforward.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze the described trajectory before writing the code. Consider overlapping parts where necessary (it's not normal curve, it's trajectory. A man's trajectory can overlap). The parameter `t` in `shape_curve(t)` may represent time in some cases.

Note: Your understanding of clock directions might be different from mine, so here's a quick reference:
12 o'clock: Straight ahead
3 o'clock: Directly to your right
6 o'clock: Directly behind you
9 o'clock: Directly to your left
1-2 o'clock: Slightly to the right front
10-11 o'clock: Slightly to the left front
4-5 o'clock: Slightly to the right back
7-8 o'clock: Slightly to the left back

Note: Whether it's to the right, left, or any clock direction, it's always referenced from the perspective of the person walking this trajectory, not from the image's perspective.

**Note:** Clock directions are always referenced from the perspective of the person performing the trajectory.
Ensure that both x and y coordinates change uniformly over time (`t`). This means the trajectory should reflect a consistent speed of movement.
To ensure no "instant jumps" in the generated trajectory, specify that the trajectory function must have smooth transitions between segments. Emphasize continuity, meaning each segment's start must align with the previous segment's end, avoiding abrupt shifts. Additionally, ensure uniform speed across the entire range of `t`, with x and y coordinates changing evenly over time.
再次强调：为了确保平滑过渡，您需要调整每一段段的公式，使其从上一段的终点坐标开始，而不是独立地重新定义 x 和 y。如果有不同的t段落，每一段的开始坐标和结束坐标应该在注释中标注出来！start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y

4. **Mathematical Functions:** Present the final code strictly in the form provided below, ensuring it is correct and can run without errors and READY TO USE.

**Code Format:**

def shape_curve(t):xz
    ...

    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (start_value, end_value)
```

---

Now the input is:

"I want to draw a Description = 'A man mimics Fred Astaire’s "Top Hat Dance"'. Give me `def shape_curve(t)`."


Model: 1. **Closed or Open Trajectory Decision:** The trajectory representing "A man mimics Fred Astaire’s 'Top Hat Dance'" would be classified as **closed**. This is because the dance typically has a rhythmic and repeating motion, suggesting a form of circular movement that eventually returns to the starting point.

2. **Extract the Trajectory Using Fixed Format Breakdown:** Below are simplified dance movements based on a common interpretation of a dance like Fred Astaire's "Top Hat Dance":

   - Step forward for 1 meter
   - Spin to the right for 0.5 meters
   - Step back for 1 meter
   - Spin to the left for 0.5 meters
   - Step to the left for 1 meter
   - Step to the right for 1 meter
   - Final spin to the right for 0.5 meters back to the starting position

2.1 Each motion will smoothly connect to the next to maintain continuity.

3. **Trajectory Analysis:** The described trajectory will move through a series of linear steps and spins. Each action will thus move through specific coordinates while maintaining a uniform speed. The trajectory will involve both straight movements and circular rotations.

**Mathematical Functions:** Below is the finalized code implementing the trajectory based on the breakdown provided:

```python
import numpy as np

def shape_curve(t):
    # Define the starting coordinates
    start_x, start_y = 0, 0

    # Initialize current coordinates
    x = start_x
    y = start_y

    # Step 1: Forward motion
    if 0 <= t < 1:
        x = start_x + t * 1  # move forward 1 meter
        y = start_y
    
    # Step 2: Spin right motion
    elif 1 <= t < 2:
        angle = (t - 1) * np.pi / 2  # 90 degrees turn
        x = start_x + 1 * np.cos(angle)
        y = start_y + 1 * np.sin(angle)

    # Step 3: Backward motion
    elif 2 <= t < 3:
        x = start_x + 1 - (t - 2) * 1  # move backward 1 meter
        y = start_y 

    # Step 4: Spin left motion
    elif 3 <= t < 4:
        angle = (t - 3) * np.pi / 2  # 90 degrees turn left
        x = start_x - 1 * np.cos(angle)
        y = start_y + 1 * np.sin(angle)

    # Step 5: Step left motion
    elif 4 <= t < 5:
        x = start_x - (t - 4) * 1  # move left 1 meter
        y = start_y 

    # Step 6: Step right motion
    elif 5 <= t < 6:
        x = start_x - 1 + (t - 5) * 1  # move right 1 meter
        y = start_y 

    # Step 7: Final spin to the right
    elif 6 <= t < 7:
        angle = (t - 6) * np.pi / 2  # 90 degrees spin to the right
        x = start_x + 1 * np.cos(angle)
        y = start_y + 0 * np.sin(angle)

    # Return the final coordinates
    return x, y

# Specify the range of t (it is important)
t_range = (0, 7)
```
